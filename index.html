                <h2>Introduction</h2>
              </header>

<p>In rhetoric and writing studies, much of the scholarship about podcasting is pedagogical scholarship. Researchers have investigated using podcasts as teaching tools to develop multimodal listening habits (Ceraso, 2018), to highlight embodied writing practices (Cushman and Kelly, 2018), to rethink ancient rhetorical exercises (Detweiler, 2019), to affect social change (Choong & Bjork, 2023), to augment students’ rhetorical awareness (Klein, 2020), and to teach students to compose rhetorically with sound (Danforth & Stedman, 2018). Yet most of this research on podcasting pedagogy focuses on face-to-face teaching, not online learning.</p>			
<p>At the same time, the rapid development of online writing instruction (OWI) scholarship has provided a wealth of insights to online teachers (Warnock, 2009; Hewett & Depew, 2015; Han, Gunn, & Chidlow, 2017; Rice & Amant, 2018; Bjork, 2018; Borgman & McCardle, 2019; Hewett, Bourelle, & Warnock, 2021; Rodrigo & Mitchum, 2024; Mahaffey & Walden, 2025). Among these books, Harris & Greer (2024) stands out for its emphasis on incorporating multimedia in OWI. But OWI research has yet to fully consider podcasting as a rhetorical tool for online pedagogies.</p>				
<p>We take inspiration from these two threads of scholarship—podcast pedagogies and OWI—to ask: <em>how might a pedagogical podcast contribute to online rhetoric and writing instruction?</em>  We know that instructors in rhetoric and writing studies have long been using podcast episodes in their pedagogies. But we also know that it is less common to create a new podcast for a specific course, especially when so many instructors in our discipline teach in limited and precarious positions. Still, with the proliferation of online teaching since the Covid-19 pandemic and the continued growth of the podcasting medium, now is the time to investigate what a dedicated pedagogical podcast can offer to multimodal online writing instruction.</p>         
<p>This webtext reflects on nearly four years of producing and teaching a pedagogical podcast called <cite>Pod Uni</cite> for an online podcasting course in Aotearoa New Zealand. Rhetoric, podcasting, and teaching are all dialogic forms of engagement, so in the remainder of this webtext we offer a series of dialogic reflections on our online podcasting pedagogies, presented as short audio recordings or mini podcast episodes. These audio recordings are part of a yet-to-be-released full-length episode of <cite>Pod Uni</cite> where we provide our listeners—and our students—with a behind-the-scenes look at the rhetorical decisions that go into composing a pedagogical podcast like this. For this webtext, we have selected the most relevant parts of that episode to include here, and for each audio clip, we have highlighted specific takeaways that pertain to using a pedagogical podcast in OWI. We also include in this webtext the first two episodes of <cite>Pod Uni</cite> (only 2-minutes each) to provide important context for Kairos readers about the rhetorical and cultural context of <cite>Pod Uni</cite>. And of course, we provide a transcript for these audio recordings—as we do in <cite>Pod Uni</cite>—for accessibility. </p>	    
<p>As a compilation of short podcast episodes and audio compositions, this webtext also extends a larger transdisciplinary conversation about podcasting as scholarship. Researchers in rhetoric and writing studies have long challenged normative assumptions about the form, shape, and sound of scholarship. <cite>Kairos</cite> has a long line of webtexts that illustrate the different possibilities of audio&ndash;as&ndash;scholarship&#58; Janine Butler (2016), Crystal VanKooten (2016), José Manuel Flores and Lucía Durá (2021), Karrieann Soto Vega and Steven Hammer (2021), A.D. Carson (2021), Jonathon W. Stone (2021), Hannah McGregor and Stacey Copeland (2022), and Kyle D. Stedman (2024).<cite>Enculturation</cite> has also played an important role in laying the groundwork for audio&ndash;as&ndash;scholarship through its Sonic Projects Archive and Intermezzo texts such <cite>Tuning in to Soundwriting</cite> (Stedman, Danforth, &amp; Faris, 2021) and <cite>Sound Never Tasted So Good</cite> (Ceraso, 2019). So too has the <cite>Journal of Multimodal Rhetorics</cite> (e.g. Hammer &amp; Sieber, 2019; Soto Vega, 2019; Lambke, 2019). Additionally, disciplinary podcasts such as <cite>Rhetoricity</cite>, <cite>Pedagogue</cite>, <cite>The Big Rhetorical Podcast</cite>, <cite>Global Rhetorics</cite>, <cite>Everyone&#8217;s Writing with AI (Except Me)</cite>, <cite>Kairoscast</cite>, and many others also play an important role in the larger research ecosystem of rhetoric and writing studies. In sum, rhetoric and composition has a rich history of audio scholarship, and this webtext extends this storied scholarly tradition by incorporating a podcast into a webtext that investigates the role of podcasting in online writing pedagogies. </p>
<p>This webtext is thus both an extension of <cite>Pod Uni</cite> and a critical inquiry into its potential for rhetorical pedagogies in online environments. From our perspective, <cite>Pod Uni</cite> functions as proof-of-concept that, while not a silver bullet, illustrates how instructor-created podcasting can complement existing pedagogical strategies in online rhetoric and writing courses. </p>

              <h2>The <cite>Pod Uni</cite> Podcast and its Context</h2>
            </header>

<p>In 2021, Collin Bjork launched <cite>Pod Uni</cite>, a pedagogical podcast about podcasting. We use this podcast to teach a podcasting course, which is offered in both face-to-face and online asynchronous modes (although the vast majority of students take the online version). This podcasting course functions as a digital writing and rhetoric course where students learn rhetorical techniques and audio writing strategies to compose a single narrative nonfiction, or audio documentary, episode of a podcast. The publicly available <cite>Pod Uni</cite> podcast is also informed by rhetorical principles, although, as Dr Bjork explains later, the rhetorical elements of the podcast are often disguised with the hope that the podcast may have a wider disciplinary reach beyond rhetoric and writing courses. </p>
<p>We teach at Te Kunenga ki Pūrehuroa Massey University in Aotearoa New Zealand. Our university has been engaged in distance education for over sixty years and online education for over twenty years. In the past several years, the majority of our humanities students have been online students. Most of Aotearoa’s universities are located in the country’s larger and more expensive cities, which can be prohibitively expensive for many students. Our online courses make a university education accessible to students who live outside of these urban centers as well as to students who work full-time and/or have caretaking duties. To accommodate students’ busy work and family commitments, our online podcasting course, like many others at our institution, is primarily asynchronous. We offer a handful of optional Zoom sessions that are only lightly attended, but otherwise our course is fully delivered through the learning management system and the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> podcast.</p>
<p>For more specific context about the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> podcast, here’s the 2-minute opening episode:</p>

<h4>Transcript - Episode 1: Introduction</h4>		  
<p>Kia ora, my name is Collin Bjork. I am the host of Pod Uni, the podcast about podcasting. The goal of this podcast is to help you learn how to create your own podcast and also to help you learn how to think critically about the podcasts that we listen to. </p>
<p>I like to think of this podcast as a kind of textbook but not as heavy and hopefully a lot more fun. It will feature sometimes me speaking directly to you about podcast production techniques. Other times, I'll be speaking with experts and smart people in the field about other podcasting issues. But like any good textbook, don't listen to this podcast in order. Skip around. Listen to the episodes that interest you. </p>
<p>This podcast is produced here in Aotearoa New Zealand, so I often use te reo Māori or Māori language words like kia ora. The Māori or the tangata whenua of Aotearoa New Zealand, the people of the land, the first inhabitants of these islands. And my efforts to use Māori language are not just a recognition of the land on which I produce this podcast; they're also an acknowledgement of the rich and storied history of kōrero, of the speech history of Māori culture. </p>
<p>Ultimately, I hope that this podcast is for anyone who's interested in podcasting. I especially hope it's useful for teachers across a variety of disciplines and levels. I hope it's useful for university lecturers and high schoolers and even primary school. I hope it's useful for communication and media classes, rhetoric and writing classes, literature and culture classes. I've deliberately not applied a disciplinary lens to this podcast so that you might find episodes that are useful to you, include them in your courses, and then apply your own disciplinary lens on top of it. Thanks for listening!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Given the cultural context of this podcast and our course, we’d now like to welcome you the way that we greet our students: with the 2-minute “Episode 2: Karakia,” which opens with a karakia, or Māori chant, that pertains to the multimodal writing we do in this course.</p>

<h4>Transcript - Episode 2: Karakia</h4>
<p>Tuhia ki te rangi</p>
<p>Tuhia ki te whenua</p>		  
<p>Tuhia ki te ngākau</p>
<p>O ngā tangata katoa</p>
<p>Ko te mea nui</p>	
<p>Ko te aroha.</p>		  
<p>Haumi e Hui e! Taiki e!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nau mai, haere mai ki te Podcasting! Ko Collin toku ingoa. Nō Texas oku whānau. Kei te noho au ki Papaioea.</p>		  
<p></p>
<p>Kia ora, my name is Collin Bjork. My family is from Texas. I live now here in Palmerston North Aotearoa New Zealand, and this is the podcast about podcasting.</p>
<p></p>	
<p>We begin with a karakia, with a chant, from Māori culture about "tuhia," which is related to the word "tuhituhi" (to write). But this notion of tuhia or tuhituhi predates European notions of writing. Indeed, tuhituhi might be more like something like to inscribe or to make one's mark on the world or to make one's mark, as the karakia says, on the sky, the land, and the hearts of the people. Indeed, podcasting is this opportunity to mark the world and the hearts of others through our kōrero, through our speech, and indeed to be marked in return through the kōrero of others. This is what the podcasting and the karakia attunes our energies to. The next part of the karakia says ko te mea nui, ko te aroha: "the most important thing is love," (the aroha). Now it might sound wild to western ears to think of podcasting as aroha, as love, but indeed, to show compassion, to listen carefully with empathy--not an interrogation, not an extraction, but a careful listening, a true dialogue--this is the opportunity to show aroha, to show love. And indeed, then, we can haumi e, we can bind it and stitch it together; stitch together our communities, our dialogue, ourselves, our world. This is what the karakia orients ourselves to. This is why we open a podcast about podcasting with "tuhia ki te rangi," the karakia. Thanks for listening! Kia ora.</p>

<h5>Audio Transcript</h5>		  
<p><i>[Upbeat electric guitar and drumset in a major key.]</i></p>	
<p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>	
<p><strong>[<em>excited</em>]</strong><i>Kia ora</i> Collin!</p>  
<p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>	
<p><strong>[<em>excited</em>]</strong><i>Kia ora</i> Melissa!</p> 
<p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>       
<p>So <cite>Pod Uni</cite> is a teaching tool or pedagogical tool. Could you tell me a bit about the origin story of the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> podcast, particularly thinking about rhetoric?</p>        	  
<p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>	
<p>Sure thing. So I taught podcasting in the States while I was working on my Ph.D., and then I moved to Aotearoa New Zealand.
    <i>Aotearoa</i> is the Indigenous name for New Zealand. And I had the chance to design a podcasting course here, which I was quite excited about. So I started working on the design in 2019 and 2020 prior to the pandemic. And one of the unique things about teaching at Massey University is that we teach many of our classes in both face&ndash;to&ndash;face and online modes.
    So we will have online students from all around Aotearoa New Zealand, and sometimes overseas, Australia...actually my first semester at Massey, I taught students on six of seven continents. And since then I've actually taught a firefighter in Antarctica. So it's a very unique teaching environment here at Massey.
    </p> 	  
    <p>And I was trying to think of ways to make sure that the podcasting course I was designing would suit online students as well as face&ndash;to&ndash;face students. And I remember my partner said, <strong>[<em>in a voice that knows it's asking a leading question</em>]</strong> "Hey, are you going to teach podcasting <em>via podcast?</em>" <strong>[<em>laughs</em>]</strong> And she said that to me while I was walking out the door one day to go to the university. And then at the university, one of the administrators I work with asked me the <em>same</em> question that same day, and I thought, okay, this is...this is... a brilliant idea that I can't take credit for, thanks to my partner and to our admin here. But I thought that was a fruitful way of reaching our online students...one that is medium appropriate, right? It's an audio pedagogical medium for teaching audio production and audio cultures and listening. And it's also a way that meets our online students’ needs. Because many of our online students are working professionals, they're working full time, they're parents, they're caretakers, they're commuting to and from work.
        And so podcasting is actually a useful medium. We're talking about only audio podcasting in <cite>Pod Uni</cite>, although I do upload videos to <cite>YouTube</cite> with still images. But it's a mode of teaching that I think suits our online students very well. And actually, we give the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> episodes to the internal students as well.
        So this was the origin of it. And it's important too, because our online teaching is <em>asynchronous</em>. So we're not having synchronous zoom sessions with our students, although you and I&mdash;we both teach this course together&mdash;have since added a synchronous Zoom session once a month around the major assignments in the course. 
        But really, we're mostly asynchronous. And so this podcast is a way to get some content, some knowledge, some skills development to the online students.                 
        </p>
<p>Now, there are two things I was thinking about when I was approaching this from a rhetorical lens, right? So I'm thinking, "Okay, I'm creating a podcast. Who is my audience?"
    And I already told you some of the student audience, but I also thought, wouldn't it be cool if this is a public facing tool, if it's not just a textbook that's inside the four walls of my classroom. It's public, publicly accessible out there. <em>Who else might find this useful?</em> So I wanted to make it nondiscipline specific.
    I love rhetoric and would be happy to proselytize rhetoric to everybody, but I wanted it to be able to be taken up, for example, in <em>high school</em> media studies classes, to be taken up in intermediate school classes, or even primary school...I wanted it to be able to be taken up in a workplace environment, for example. Any place where people would find this information about how to podcast, how to think about podcast cultures and production useful, I wanted it to be able to be taken up. So I deliberately did not foreground a rhetorical lens. 
    </p>	
<p> That being said, the second thing is: <strong>[<em>smiling</em>]</strong> I'm a rhetorician; I can't help but <em>smuggle</em> the rhetoric in there. For me, a lot of the episodes are foregrounding questions of audience, which has historically been important to rhetoric.
    It's asking listeners to think carefully about who their listeners are and to not think of their listeners as homogenous, but actually as quite diverse, and how do you speak to those diverse audiences? And when I'm talking about interviews, or conducting interviews with other podcasters, I'm always thinking of myself as a <em>surrogate for my listeners</em>, right?
    I'm imagining what kind of questions do my listeners want to know? Some of them are students. Some of them are not university students. And what are they likely to want to know out of my interviews? So those are, that's the origin story, and that's sort of some of the design elements that went into my initial thinking about the podcast. </p>
<p>Yeah, and I should say too, just to clarify, right now the podcast has two seasons. The first season is monopod, where it's me giving a few episodes of <em>how&ndash;to</em> podcasts, each one about a different topic...about narration, about vocal delivery, about sound design, et cetera.
    And the second season is a bunch of interviews with podcasting experts or storytelling experts from around Aotearoa New Zealand.
    </p>


<h3>Takeaway 2</h3>
<h4>Design for multiple audiences from the start because pedagogical podcasts are both student-facing and public-facing. </h4>

<h5>Audio Transcript</h5>		  
    <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>	
    <p>Could you tell us a bit about <cite>Pod Uni</cite>'s audience as you see it now? So do you want to say some more about the initial audience?
        </p>  
        <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>	
<p>Yeah, so, the audience for the podcast is diverse, right?
    So I think of at least two audiences for the podcast. And the initial audience that I was designing for was my students. So this is primarily a pedagogical tool; it's a rhetorical tool that I'm designing to teach. Our podcasting course does teach some rhetorical principles explicitly in the course and in terms of asking students to think about when they're producing their podcast or listening to podcasts, who are the audiences, what is the cultural context, et cetera.
    So our students are getting that wraparound rhetorical content in the course, even if the podcast isn't explicitly foregrounding it. 
    </p> 
<p>So who is the audience for the podcast <cite>Pod Uni</cite>? Our students are quite diverse, right? Our Massey University students are primarily Kiwis, but they're not always.
    We have <em>international</em> students. Some of our Kiwi students are working overseas, as I said in my first answer. Many of them live and work in Australia. Many of our students, whether they're face&ndash;to&ndash;face students or online students, are Indigenous students, right? So Māori are the Indigenous peoples of Aotearoa New Zealand.
    And also there are many Pacific Indigenous students from Tonga and Samoa who take our courses...up to around 30 percent, give or take, every semester. 
    </p>
<p>And I think that's a really important part of how I rhetorically think about designing this course, right? It's why, after my initial trailer episode, the very first episode after that is the <i>Karakia</i>.
    A <i>karakia</i> is a kind of chant, a way of&mdash;at least an opening <i>karakia</i> is&mdash;a way of bringing people together, welcoming them into a shared space and asking them to reflect on some of the values and things that will be going on in a course like this, or in a podcast like this. And that's why you and I start by saying <i>Kia ora</i>. <i>Kia ora</i> is a Māori greeting here in Aotearoa, New Zealand.
    There are ways in which my being placed here in Aotearoa New Zealand, where I've learned a lot from Māori culture and I want to foreground those elements for our students explicitly. I think that's part of creating <i>manaakitanga</i>, right, which is this Māori word for kind of wrapping...I like to think of it as like wrapping each other in a warm cloak of <em>hospitality</em>, really.
    </p>
<p>So there are those elements, but also, as I said earlier, these students, many of them are working full time or are parents, are caretakers, et cetera. So this is again, why this <em>asynchronous</em> medium, this <em>audio&ndash;on&ndash;demand</em> is...it is an appropriate medium for them to listen to while they're doing the washing, while they're cooking dinner, while they're making their commutes, right?
    This is a useful way for them to be studying while doing a lot of the other duties that come along with being an online student. That's the first kind of audience. 
    </p>
<p>The second audience is the wider, what I think of as the <i>podcast&ndash;curious public</i>. We always tell our students in the course, Melissa, right: <strong>[<em>exaggerated disciplinary voice</em>]</strong> &ldquo;Don't say you're writing for a general public. That's <em>too vague</em>. That's not helpful.&rdquo; <strong>[<em>laughs</em>]</strong> And that's why I think of our public audience as a <i>podcast&ndash;curious</i> audience. So who's listening to it? Who's not our students? It's a lot of our university colleagues. I know it's other people who wonder how podcasts get made, right?
    I go to the New Zealand Podcast Summit every year, and I know that some listeners, whether they're producers themselves, podcasters, aspiring and budding podcasters, whether they're creators, like quite a few <cite>YouTube</cite> creators, I think, listen. So we've got a diverse mix of people who are interested in lifting the hood on the production of podcasts and the kinds of things to be thinking about when producing podcasts, listening to podcasts and thinking about podcast cultures more largely.
    </p>
<p>So how do I reach that larger secondary audience? Well, for example, that's where I think the Season 2 interviews can be quite helpful. Right? One of the questions that I get the most often, both from students and nonstudents is: <strong>[<em>exaggerated whispering voice</em>]</strong> "How can I make money off of my podcast?" <strong>[<em>Melissa laughs</em>]</strong> I don't have a clue about how to make money off of a podcast!
    I'm a humanities scholar! I'm a rhetoric scholar! <strong>[<em>Melissa laughs again</em>]</strong>  I can talk about culture and language, but making money, I don't know. So that's why the first interview I did was with a <cite>YouTube</cite> creator, Jesse Willson, right? So I'm always thinking about future episodes through the lens of my audience.
    I think also I interviewed Luce Blakiston from the <cite>Shit You Should Care About</cite> media crew, right, who became quite popular during Covid, although they were around for well before that. And I think that's an audience that reaches actually multiple generations. I remember talking with her...she's from the generation below me, but actually she has tons of listeners who are my generation or older.
    So that's a way that we're reaching across these generations cause most of our students are not even high school leavers, right? They're actually closer to my age and I think quite a few of the public listeners are also folks, you know, in a variety of generations, and I think an interview like that with Luce Blakiston from <cite>Shit You Should Care About</cite>&mdash;how do you create this, how do you become a content creator and create a whole media business from scratch?&mdash;that's an interview that can reach a diverse audience both here in Aotearoa New Zealand, but also in the States. 
    </p>
<p>I know that I have listeners in a few other Anglophone countries as well. Not a lot! We don't have, we're not a massive enterprise here. I don't have a lot of money and time to spend on marketing.
    So we're not a big enterprise, but I'd like to think that we're working on creating an enriched community here via <cite>Pod Uni</cite>.

    <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>	
    <p>Are there ways that you think you can improve or modify how the podcast works for its audience or audiences?</p>  
    <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
<p><strong>[<em>musing loudly </em>]</strong> Mmmmm. Mmmmmm. One thing I would <em>love</em> to do is I would love for Season 3 to be student podcasts. <strong>[<em>smiling </em>]</strong> That's what I would love. There are a few like technical, logistical&mdash;hopefully not legal&mdash;hoops that need to be jumped through in order to make that happen. But I think that's another way to reach students...to show off excellent student podcasts that have been produced in our course. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>	
    <p>There have been some great ones.</p>
    <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
    <p><strong>[<em>really excited</em>]</strong> There have been some good ones! Right? Yeah! </p>
<p>But I think also that that showing off  excellent student work also builds a wider community because the students are often plugged into...the stories that they tell on our podcasts are often quite local and they, the students, come with all different kinds of backgrounds and expertise and communities, and that's a way to, again, grow this, and enrich this, <cite>Pod Uni</cite> community because when a student podcast comes up, then they share it with their <i>whānau</i>.
  <i>Whānau</i> is the Māori word for family, right? They share it widely with their <i>whānau</i> and their friends, and it can invite another layer of people into the fold of <cite>Pod Uni</cite>. So I think that's one place I'd like to grow the podcast directly for audience reasons.</p>    
    <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>	
    <p>That sounds great. I think that'd be really interesting to hear those. And I think that they...the student podcasts would also help grow the local podcasting enthusiasm.</p>
    <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
    <p>Totally. I always learn stuff from our student podcasts, right? <strong>[<em>laughs</em>]</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>	
    <p><strong>[<em>smiling</em>]</strong> Yeah, me too.</p>
    <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
    <p>That's one of the great things about when I came here and learned the Māori word <i>ako</i>, which often gets translated into English as...<strong>[<em>pausing</em>]</strong>..."to teach or to learn," but it really does mean that bidirectional thing, right?
        It means bidirectional...that you're...<i>ako</i> is not unidirectional of me the podcast expert saying, <strong>[<em>exaggerated teaching voice </em>]</strong> "Open your brain, and I fill your brain with info." It's actually...we're also learning from our students at the same time as they're learning from us. And I love that that Māori concept of teaching and learning is always bidirectional.
        And I think that's <em>emblematic</em> of what we have in this podcasting class.</p>
        <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>	
        <p>Yeah, That's so true, and two&ndash;way learning is definitely what happens.</p>



<h3>Takeaway 4</h3>
<h4>Think capaciously about form, rhetorical purpose, interviewees, and even funding opportunities for a pedagogical podcast. </h4>

<h5>Audio Transcript</h5>		  
                <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>	
                <p>That makes a lot of sense.</p>
                <p>So, thinking about experts, as a rhetorician yourself, could you tell us about Seasons 1 and 2 of <cite>Pod Uni</cite> through the lens of rhetoric?</p>
            <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>  
<p>Yes. So Season 1, as I said earlier, is <i>monopod</i>. Monopod means it's just me speaking into the mic, not dialogic.
    I do think podcasting is a dialogic medium, so I don't think monopod is necessarily making the most of it, but that's why you and I are doing a dialogue here. But I do think monopod can be instructive for these very how&ndash;to podcasts. So Season 1 is how to do narration, how to do interview technique, how to do story structure, how to do sound design.
    And I was already planning on doing those prior to Covid, but then Covid hit. <strong>[<em>chuckles</em>]</strong> And I think that those came in very helpful as a kind of short, as abbreviated and focused, mini lectures, let's say 18&ndash;minute lectures on each one of these topics. But I hope that they're not just instructing on technique.
    I hope they're also inspiring. I hope they also give space for listeners to imagine themselves conducting an interview with confidence or going into vocal delivery, which many people are quite nervous about, with some kind of understanding of how their bodies, their breath, and their voice can come together to really represent who they are.
    So I <em>hope</em> that they're designed rhetorically to both instruct and to inspire. 
    </p>
<p>As for Season 2, which is a collection of interviews with experts. It's quite diverse. The first thing to say is that I didn't limit it to just podcasters. I think this is maybe the rhetorician in me.
    Rhetoricians are often&mdash;and I would say that you yourself too, Melissa&mdash;we wear many hats. We contain multitudes, right? <strong>[<em>both laugh</em>]</strong> And I think that what I was thinking when I was thinking about who to interview, I thought, "Oh, it's quite narrow if I just interview people who do podcasting."
    Whereas, like when I interviewed Whiti Hereaka&mdash;who is my super smart creative writing colleague here, who won an award for her awesome novel, <cite>Kurangaituku</cite>&mdash;I thought I want to interview her on storytelling. She's an impressive storyteller. She's also written for the stage. So she knows how to write for the ear. Actually, I thought her novel sounded like it was written for the ear.
    So I thought, I think that an interview like that...she's not a podcaster, but I think that can inform how we do podcasting, how we think about writing for the ear, how we think about storytelling. And so I take quite a capacious approach to the interviews on Season 2 cause I think that's valuable to think widely about the many different techniques and skill sets that inform podcasting, not just to think narrowly in terms of who is and is not a podcaster.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
<p>That makes a lot of sense. I like the way that the first season is, as you say, narrow and instructive. Narrow is my word. <strong>[<em>chuckles</em>]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I think that's appropriate. </p>
<p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
<p>Yeah and you've really broadened that out in Season 2 into that much wider net of first going from the dialogic monopod to dialogic, and then also getting a range of interviewees.
    I think that's quite useful. Also for students to listen to as a way of showing that they don't have to do the just one style of podcast, or there's only one type of person to interview. There are many opportunities.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
<p>That's right. That's something we emphasize in the course is that we're constantly showing students different ways of storytelling, vocal delivery, et cetera. What we're NOT trying to do in this course is reproduce a lot of the problematic things <strong>[<em>Melissa chuckles</em>]</strong> that radio has been guilty of for a long time, which is like making everyone sound like a white dude, right? <strong>[<em>Melissa audibly affirms</em>]</strong> Like those kinds of things. So we're being capacious in how we teach the course. But I think also, yeah, I hope that the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> podcast is also capacious. I think there's still room to expand some more.
</p>
<p>Yeah, but it's nascent, let's say. Like, when did the podcast come out? We've been doing it for three&ndash;ish years now. And of course, <em>teaching</em> podcasting is part of my job, but <em>producing</em> a podcast is not explicitly a part of my job, even though it is a pedagogical tool.
    I would love to get some funding. I think one way that the podcast could grow is getting some funding to bring more people into the fold of the production side of things...to grow it and get more heads in on the future directions of this so that, yeah, so that it can be more community driven, I guess.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
    <p>Yeah, a lot of podcasts do have a full team behind them, although there are also plenty of solo podcasts as well.</p>

              <h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
            </header>
<p>When designing a pedagogical podcast for OWI, we argue that a pedagogical podcast can complement and amplify existing online writing pedagogies, but like any pedagogical tool, it’s not without its downsides. In the following audio clip, Dr Gunn discusses the benefits and drawbacks of both producing and teaching with a pedagogical podcast in OWI. </p>
<h3>Benefits:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A pedagogical podcast is a helpful resource for online students, especially ones who have lots of time constraints (e.g. parents, full-time workers, and caretakers)</li>
	<li>A pedagogical podcast helps instructors empathise with students engaged in multimodal composition</li>
	<li>A pedagogical podcast is a valuable multidisciplinary and multimodal activity for instructors’ own professional development</li>
</ul>
		  
<h3>Drawbacks:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Not all students listen to the pedagogical podcast, including the students who may need it most (but this is a perennial problem in teaching)
</li>
	<li>It’s a LOT of work to produce and promote a pedagogical podcast to a high standard
It would be more effective if a pedagogical podcast not only provided 
</li>
	<li>It would be more effective if a pedagogical podcast not only provided meta-commentary about multimodal composition but also provided examples of multimodal composition, including examples composed by students</li>
</ul>

<h5>Audio Transcript</h5>		  
    <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p> 
<p>So tell me a little bit more about what your own experience has been teaching <cite>Pod Uni</cite> the podcast or teaching with it. Because when I asked if you wanted to coteach this with me, I had sort of already...or I was in the process of getting this up and running and then said, "Hey, here's this teaching tool."
    So I'd be curious to know a little bit more about your own experience using the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> podcast in our pedagogy.</p>
    <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
    <p>Sure. I guess the first thing is, perhaps, the most obvious thing for anyone who has taught students, is that the more motivated students are the ones who report listening to it most.</p>
    <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
    <p>That's right. I'm under no illusion that every single student listens to every episode. <strong>[<em>laughs</em>]</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
    <p>Yeah, that's inevitable. But I do think that the more practical monopod, the first series, is a really useful primer for those, especially for those who are new to producing a podcast. And I think that they do get a lot of listens, possibly only in the last few weeks when they're desperately trying to catch up to making their podcast <strong>[<em>both chuckling</em>]</strong>, but I think that they do view that as a useful resource. Because it is definitely...the more enthusiastic ones do appreciate the second series episodes as examples, and so I think actually they would <em>love</em> to have that opportunity of hearing more shorter narrative nonfiction podcasts as examples for themselves because if there's one thing I've learnt that students love to have examples.
        </p>
    <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
     <p>Yes. So you're saying if we put more student examples up as a third season, they would appreciate that? Yeah, that's right.</p>
     <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
     <p>Yeah. It's really useful for students to have the ability to listen to something on the go. Particularly those asynchronous students, the distance students who have a lot going on in their lives. If you can just plug your earpods in and listen to the podcast while you're doing other things, it's so helpful when you're trying to juggle your multiple time commitments. And I think that they appreciate that. One of the difficult things I think is that potentially the students who could do with listening to it the most don't necessarily get that listening in.
        I think that's also a perennial teaching problem. But they do, all the students, I think, listen to more podcasts by the end of the course than when they started. I know that we've had some students who have never listened to a podcast before, but by the end of the course, they've listened to a whole slew of them, and some of them have become absolutely converts to podcasting.
        So I think that the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> is part of that. So even though they might not have <cite>Pod Uni</cite> on a multiple play repeat list, they're still getting something from the course.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p> 
<p>I hope so. Yeah. Aw, that's good to hear.</p>
<p>Tell me about your experience <em>producing</em> some of the...you've produced three of the most recent episodes...<strong>[<em>Melissa laughs</em>]</strong> What's it been like to be on the back end of this pedagogical tool?</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
<p>Oh, it's been really interesting. I have so much more sympathy with the students producing their podcasts now. <strong>[<em>laughs again</em>]</strong> But useful also to view it from both sides. So to have, okay, we've got this tool that we can listen to. How does it work?
    What are the moving parts? And how do they fit together? So that's been really useful for me to, like I said, to have sympathy, but also have a better understanding of some of the challenges that student podcasters can have using different equipment, making a space more friendly for podcasting.
    So it makes me think about technical challenges and search for solutions. But it also makes me appreciate how much tools make a difference, so it's absolutely possible to make a podcast with the most basic of tools, but sometimes having better tools makes it better. <strong>[<em>laughs knowingly</em>]</strong>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, it saves time usually. And you're editing in <cite>Audacity</cite>, the free open source software. And you've had to tidy up some of my <em>less high quality audio</em>, let's say the particular...doing the live episode of the podcast at the New Zealand Podcast Summit. I think was quite the challenge for you to produce that episode.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
        <p><strong>[<em>knowingly</em>]</strong> Yeah, that was an interesting introduction to editing live.</p>
        <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
        <p>Yeah. Thank you for your <i>mahi</i> on that. <i>Mahi</i> is the Māori word for work. Yeah, appreciate the work that went into that.</p>
        <p>Yeah, and I think I feel the same way. You said that you have a more kind of sympathy or empathy for and with the students. And I totally agree.
            Every time...cause I only do these episodes every few months. I'm not doing it weekly by any stretch of the imagination. I think every time I get back into it, I go, <strong>[<em>mock surprised voice</em>]</strong> "Oh, right, this does require a lot of different things." Both the software, the listening, the microphone technique, the writing, the episode descriptions, gathering the transcripts, putting the transcripts on the website, right?
            There's a lot that goes into this work. So I always, every time I do it, I'm reminded of those challenges.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
            <p><strong>[<em>chuckling</em>]</strong> Yeah, it's a multidisciplinary task really, which is one of the things I really like about it actually, because you have different things to focus on at different times. So you've got your practical, getting the sound in the first place, then you've got editing the sound. Or actually, you're, first of all, you're academic writing, the questions, thinking about what you want to ask, doing the interview, so getting the sound, and then cleaning it up <strong>[<em>chuckles knowingly</em>]</strong>, making it sound the way you really wanted it to sound. They're all a lot of different skills that go into it. </p>

              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            </header>

<p>As we outline above, when teaching multimodal composition online, a pedagogical podcast can complement existing pedagogies by providing students with an opportunity to engage course content on their own time in a medium that aligns with both their multimodal writing goals and with their needs as online students. A pedagogical podcast also provides an opportunity to showcase examples of multimodal composition and even prior students’ work. And as a public-facing medium, a pedagogical podcast can help connect university communities with larger public interest groups. But a pedagogical podcast does require considerable additional work for instructors who may already work in precarious contexts. And as with print textbooks, there’s no guarantee that students will consistently engage with a pedagogical podcast. </p>
<p>Still, we contend that a pedagogical podcast is—especially in an audio composition course—one productive way to engage online students and to complement existing pedagogical strategies. And although podcasts can sometimes appear to exist in an amorphous digital ether that is detached from a local context, we found that it was enriching for both our students and for our wider listenership to ground our podcast in our immediate cultural context here on Māori whenua in Aotearoa New Zealand. We encourage other instructors who create a pedagogical podcast to do the same. We are certain that there is much more to be learned about pedagogical podcasting in both online and face-to-face teaching in rhetoric and composition, and we look forward to hearing what future teacher-researchers accomplish by including pedagogical podcasts in their own courses. </p>

            <h3><strong>(0:00) Introduction</strong></h3>
<p><i>[Upbeat electric guitar and drumset in a major key.]</i></p>		  
<p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
<p><i>Kia ora</i>. I'm Collin Bjork, and welcome back to the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> podcast, the podcast about podcasting. </p>
<p>This episode is a very special one. In this episode, we're going to offer a behind the scenes look into how and why we made decisions about constructing the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> podcast in the ways that we have so far. So we'll look back at the past and the present of <cite>Pod Uni</cite> and with an eye towards where we might want to go in the future of this podcast. But this episode is going to be especially important because it will be peer reviewed. </p>
<p>Now, what is peer review? Peer review is that academic process where experts conduct some research, identify what they believe is some new knowledge in whatever field they're studying, and they typically write that up and send it off to other experts, who then review that knowledge, provide feedback on it, evaluate its credibility, and then after some back and forth, usually between the authors and the reviewers, hopefully, that research is published as new knowledge in the field. </p>
<p>But you may be wondering: this is an audio podcast; this isn't a written text. So why would an audio text be peer reviewed? Well, since the advent of podcasting, at least, perhaps a bit before that, scholars have been debating in both the fields of rhetoric and writing Studies, and in podcast studies and media Studies, they've been debating whether or not audio podcasting, whether or not this audio medium, can itself be a mode of publishing scholarship, of sharing new knowledge. </p>
<p>And this has led to some <em>really</em> interesting conversations in the field. Stacey Copeland and Hannah McGregor have published recently on this in <cite>Kairos</cite> journal. Eric Detweiler has been editing a really cool audio section of the <cite>enculturation</cite> journal. There's been lots of other really interesting audio scholarship out there where people are making the case that audio is not just a <em>means</em> for sharing existing research, but actually is itself <em>constitutive</em> of new knowledge. And this is a really exciting development in the field, and I hope that this episode of <cite>Pod Uni</cite> can be part of that larger conversation.</p>
<p>So if we're producing new research, we need to have a kind of argument. And I would sort of say that this conversation that you will hear in this episode, which is between Dr Melissa Gunn and myself, who coteach the podcasting course at Massey University and have both been involved in this <cite>Pod Uni</cite> podcast, that what we're ultimately trying to argue is that the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> podcast is a rhetorically attuned audio teaching tool that helps students, the wider public and even us, the podcast producers, learn about podcast production and podcast cultures here in Aotearoa New Zealand. Now we're not claiming that <cite>Pod Uni</cite> is perfect. It's certainly not; and we talk about some of the opportunities for improvement in this episode. But that this, like any tool, is an opportunity to teach, to reflect on our own teaching, and to iterate and continue to improve. </p>
<p>What do we mean by <i>rhetorically attuned</i>? That's kind of a strange phrase, right? By rhetorically attuned we mean: aware of its audience, aware of the cultural context that <cite>Pod Uni</cite> is emerging from, and you'll hear some of that in the dialog that Melissa and I have. So rhetoric is both the lens through which we teach our podcasting course and the lens through which I composed the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> podcast in collaboration with those around me, including Dr Melissa Gunn. </p>
<p>So rhetoric is an ancient discipline, right? It's a discipline that some people trace back to ancient Greece. That's where the term rhetoric comes from. But actually many, many cultures have rhetorical traditions. And rhetorical studies has been really terrific recently, in the past several decades, of uncovering those stories of rhetorical traditions elsewhere in the world, in China and India and all kinds of terrific and fascinating places. And rhetoric is often described as persuasion, but it's also a mode of communication, and I like to think of it as...<strong>[<em>pause</em>]</strong><em>...a tool for building community</em>. Sometimes that's teaching and learning communities, sometimes that's wider publics that all care about certain shared issues of concern. So rhetoric is this really versatile tool. Rhetoricians always debate about different definitions of rhetoric, and that's quite exciting to nerds like me, but this is what we mean by rhetoric, that this podcast is rhetorically attuned: meaning it's aware of its audience and its cultural context and its teaching context. Cause this is ultimately a teaching tool, both for our students and, I hope, for the wider public, and as I said, for ourselves. </p>
<p>So now, before we jump into the conversation between Dr Melissa Gunn and myself about the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> podcast and its origins and our reflections on it, I want to tell you a little bit about where we are submitting this episode for peer review. We are sending it to a journal called <cite>Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric, Technology, and Pedagogy</cite>. Now, <i>kairos</i> is an ancient Greek term that often gets translated as something like timeliness. Something is <em>kairotic</em> if it happens in a really timely and opportune moment, let's say. And <cite>Kairos</cite> is a really terrific journal. It's a journal that I've admired for some time now because it emphasizes, as the subheading mentions, <em>rhetoric, technology and pedagogy</em>. So it's interested in: how is technology involved in rhetorical activity and teaching activity? How do we use technologies rhetorically? How are technologies incorporated in the rhetoric and teaching that we do? So I think actually this episode, where we're reflecting on the audio technology of a podcast and its emphasis on teaching and its role in our podcast pedagogy, I hope that this is a snug fit for <cite>Kairos</cite> journal. </p>
<p>One thing that I <em>love</em> about <cite>Kairos</cite> is that it's not just about the <em>content</em> that matters to them, it's also that <em>the shape of the text that you submit to them has to augment your argument</em>. And what do we mean by that? We mean that they do not accept a written 8000&ndash;word research journal article. They accept digital texts, what they call <i>webtexts</i>. And the design of your webtext, your digital text that you submit to them, has to support your argument. So if we're arguing here that <cite>Pod Uni</cite> is a rhetorically attuned pedagogical tool for teaching podcasting and rhetorical ways of thinking about audio, we've chosen&mdash;Melissa and I in this episode&mdash;to submit it as an <em>audio file</em>, because that is representative of the argument that we're making about <cite>Pod Uni</cite> as a podcast. So we're submitting a podcast episode to make a claim about how this podcast functions, rhetorically and pedagogically. So that's one thing I've admired about <cite>Kairos</cite>, is that it thinks <em>critically</em> about the ways that, not just the content of the argument that we make, but also the design, the technological shape of the argument, is also a component of the rhetorical aspects of that new knowledge and scholarship. So that's an exciting thing about <cite>Kairos</cite> journal.</p>
<p>We are submitting this to the Inventio section. So this is this thing about journals: academic journals often have different sections that ask you to focus on different things, and the Inventio section of <cite>Kairos</cite> asks scholars to reflect on the process of invention, of creating a digital tool, often for pedagogical purposes, and to sort of unpack the rhetorical design around creating that technology for its pedagogical purposes. <i>Inventio</i> is this Latin word that's often translated as <i>invention</i>, right? They're related terms, and invention is the term that that rhetoricians use when we mean to create, to come up with in your mind, right? To create, to create an argument, or in this case, to create a technology that is itself an argument, right? So we're arguing that <cite>Pod Uni</cite> is not just a digital technology, an audio technology that we've created to help teach the podcasting course, but that it's actually rhetorically attuned to the needs of its many and diverse listeners, which Melissa and I will talk about later.</p>
<p>So this is the aim and the shape of this podcast. And in this reflection, you'll hear us talk, as I said, about the origins of the podcast, its audiences, how we use it in our teaching, how it's differed over the course of Seasons 1 and Seasons 2, and where we hope it might go in the future. So I really hope that you find this a valuable listening experience. It certainly has been informative and valuable for Melissa and I to put it together.</p>

<p><strong>[<em>excited</em>]</strong><i>Kia ora</i> Collin!</p>  
<p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>	
<p><strong>[<em>excited</em>]</strong><i>Kia ora</i> Melissa!</p> 
<p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>       
<p>So <cite>Pod Uni</cite> is a teaching tool or pedagogical tool. Could you tell me a bit about the origin story of the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> podcast, particularly thinking about rhetoric?</p>        	  
<p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>	
<p>Sure thing. So I taught podcasting in the States while I was working on my Ph.D., and then I moved to Aotearoa New Zealand.
    <i>Aotearoa</i> is the Indigenous name for New Zealand. And I had the chance to design a podcasting course here, which I was quite excited about. So I started working on the design in 2019 and 2020 prior to the pandemic. And one of the unique things about teaching at Massey University is that we teach many of our classes in both face&ndash;to&ndash;face and online modes.
    So we will have online students from all around Aotearoa New Zealand, and sometimes overseas, Australia...actually my first semester at Massey, I taught students on six of seven continents. And since then I've actually taught a firefighter in Antarctica. So it's a very unique teaching environment here at Massey.
    </p> 	  
    <p>And I was trying to think of ways to make sure that the podcasting course I was designing would suit online students as well as face&ndash;to&ndash;face students. And I remember my partner said, <strong>[<em>in a voice that knows it's asking a leading question</em>]</strong> "Hey, are you going to teach podcasting <em>via podcast?</em>" <strong>[<em>laughs</em>]</strong> And she said that to me while I was walking out the door one day to go to the university. And then at the university, one of the administrators I work with asked me the <em>same</em> question that same day, and I thought, okay, this is...this is... a brilliant idea that I can't take credit for, thanks to my partner and to our admin here. But I thought that was a fruitful way of reaching our online students...one that is medium appropriate, right? It's an audio pedagogical medium for teaching audio production and audio cultures and listening. And it's also a way that meets our online students’ needs. Because many of our online students are working professionals, they're working full time, they're parents, they're caretakers, they're commuting to and from work.
        And so podcasting is actually a useful medium. We're talking about only audio podcasting in <cite>Pod Uni</cite>, although I do upload videos to <cite>YouTube</cite> with still images. But it's a mode of teaching that I think suits our online students very well. And actually, we give the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> episodes to the internal students as well.
        So this was the origin of it. And it's important too, because our online teaching is <em>asynchronous</em>. So we're not having synchronous zoom sessions with our students, although you and I&mdash;we both teach this course together&mdash;have since added a synchronous Zoom session once a month around the major assignments in the course. 
        But really, we're mostly asynchronous. And so this podcast is a way to get some content, some knowledge, some skills development to the online students.                 
        </p>
<p>Now, there are two things I was thinking about when I was approaching this from a rhetorical lens, right? So I'm thinking, "Okay, I'm creating a podcast. Who is my audience?"
    And I already told you some of the student audience, but I also thought, wouldn't it be cool if this is a public facing tool, if it's not just a textbook that's inside the four walls of my classroom. It's public, publicly accessible out there. <em>Who else might find this useful?</em> So I wanted to make it nondiscipline specific.
    I love rhetoric and would be happy to proselytize rhetoric to everybody, but I wanted it to be able to be taken up, for example, in <em>high school</em> media studies classes, to be taken up in intermediate school classes, or even primary school...I wanted it to be able to be taken up in a workplace environment, for example. Any place where people would find this information about how to podcast, how to think about podcast cultures and production useful, I wanted it to be able to be taken up. So I deliberately did not foreground a rhetorical lens. 
    </p>	
<p> That being said, the second thing is: <strong>[<em>smiling</em>]</strong> I'm a rhetorician; I can't help but <em>smuggle</em> the rhetoric in there. For me, a lot of the episodes are foregrounding questions of audience, which has historically been important to rhetoric.
    It's asking listeners to think carefully about who their listeners are and to not think of their listeners as homogenous, but actually as quite diverse, and how do you speak to those diverse audiences? And when I'm talking about interviews, or conducting interviews with other podcasters, I'm always thinking of myself as a <em>surrogate for my listeners</em>, right?
    I'm imagining what kind of questions do my listeners want to know? Some of them are students. Some of them are not university students. And what are they likely to want to know out of my interviews? So those are, that's the origin story, and that's sort of some of the design elements that went into my initial thinking about the podcast. </p>
<p>Yeah, and I should say too, just to clarify, right now the podcast has two seasons. The first season is monopod, where it's me giving a few episodes of <em>how&ndash;to</em> podcasts, each one about a different topic...about narration, about vocal delivery, about sound design, et cetera.
    And the second season is a bunch of interviews with podcasting experts or storytelling experts from around Aotearoa New Zealand.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>	
    <p>Wow. There's a lot there. So I love that the original idea came from outside, and that it was obvious to other people that this was a clear way to do it. But then you've made that happen.
        So that's pretty cool. You were talking about the audience and that you see yourself as a surrogate for the audience. Could you tell us a bit about <cite>Pod Uni</cite>'s audience as you see it now? So do you want to say some more about the initial audience?
        </p>  
        <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>	
<p>Yeah, so, the audience for the podcast is diverse, right?
    So I think of at least two audiences for the podcast. And the initial audience that I was designing for was my students. So this is primarily a pedagogical tool; it's a rhetorical tool that I'm designing to teach. Our podcasting course does teach some rhetorical principles explicitly in the course and in terms of asking students to think about when they're producing their podcast or listening to podcasts, who are the audiences, what is the cultural context, et cetera.
    So our students are getting that wraparound rhetorical content in the course, even if the podcast isn't explicitly foregrounding it. 
    </p> 
<p>So who is the audience for the podcast <cite>Pod Uni</cite>? Our students are quite diverse, right? Our Massey University students are primarily Kiwis, but they're not always.
    We have <em>international</em> students. Some of our Kiwi students are working overseas, as I said in my first answer. Many of them live and work in Australia. Many of our students, whether they're face&ndash;to&ndash;face students or online students, are Indigenous students, right? So Māori are the Indigenous peoples of Aotearoa New Zealand.
    And also there are many Pacific Indigenous students from Tonga and Samoa who take our courses...up to around 30 percent, give or take, every semester. 
    </p>
<p>And I think that's a really important part of how I rhetorically think about designing this course, right? It's why, after my initial trailer episode, the very first episode after that is the <i>Karakia</i>.
    A <i>karakia</i> is a kind of chant, a way of&mdash;at least an opening <i>karakia</i> is&mdash;a way of bringing people together, welcoming them into a shared space and asking them to reflect on some of the values and things that will be going on in a course like this, or in a podcast like this. And that's why you and I start by saying <i>Kia ora</i>. <i>Kia ora</i> is a Māori greeting here in Aotearoa, New Zealand.
    There are ways in which my being placed here in Aotearoa New Zealand, where I've learned a lot from Māori culture and I want to foreground those elements for our students explicitly. I think that's part of creating <i>manaakitanga</i>, right, which is this Māori word for kind of wrapping...I like to think of it as like wrapping each other in a warm cloak of <em>hospitality</em>, really.
    </p>
<p>So there are those elements, but also, as I said earlier, these students, many of them are working full time or are parents, are caretakers, et cetera. So this is again, why this <em>asynchronous</em> medium, this <em>audio&ndash;on&ndash;demand</em> is...it is an appropriate medium for them to listen to while they're doing the washing, while they're cooking dinner, while they're making their commutes, right?
    This is a useful way for them to be studying while doing a lot of the other duties that come along with being an online student. That's the first kind of audience. 
    </p>
<p>The second audience is the wider, what I think of as the <i>podcast&ndash;curious public</i>. We always tell our students in the course, Melissa, right: <strong>[<em>exaggerated disciplinary voice</em>]</strong> &ldquo;Don't say you're writing for a general public. That's <em>too vague</em>. That's not helpful.&rdquo; <strong>[<em>laughs</em>]</strong> And that's why I think of our public audience as a <i>podcast&ndash;curious</i> audience. So who's listening to it? Who's not our students? It's a lot of our university colleagues. I know it's other people who wonder how podcasts get made, right?
    I go to the New Zealand Podcast Summit every year, and I know that some listeners, whether they're producers themselves, podcasters, aspiring and budding podcasters, whether they're creators, like quite a few <cite>YouTube</cite> creators, I think, listen. So we've got a diverse mix of people who are interested in lifting the hood on the production of podcasts and the kinds of things to be thinking about when producing podcasts, listening to podcasts and thinking about podcast cultures more largely.
    </p>
<p>So how do I reach that larger secondary audience? Well, for example, that's where I think the Season 2 interviews can be quite helpful. Right? One of the questions that I get the most often, both from students and nonstudents is: <strong>[<em>exaggerated whispering voice</em>]</strong> "How can I make money off of my podcast?" <strong>[<em>Melissa laughs</em>]</strong> I don't have a clue about how to make money off of a podcast!
    I'm a humanities scholar! I'm a rhetoric scholar! <strong>[<em>Melissa laughs again</em>]</strong>  I can talk about culture and language, but making money, I don't know. So that's why the first interview I did was with a <cite>YouTube</cite> creator, Jesse Willson, right? So I'm always thinking about future episodes through the lens of my audience.
    I think also I interviewed Luce Blakiston from the <cite>Shit You Should Care About</cite> media crew, right, who became quite popular during Covid, although they were around for well before that. And I think that's an audience that reaches actually multiple generations. I remember talking with her...she's from the generation below me, but actually she has tons of listeners who are my generation or older.
    So that's a way that we're reaching across these generations cause most of our students are not even high school leavers, right? They're actually closer to my age and I think quite a few of the public listeners are also folks, you know, in a variety of generations, and I think an interview like that with Luce Blakiston from <cite>Shit You Should Care About</cite>&mdash;how do you create this, how do you become a content creator and create a whole media business from scratch?&mdash;that's an interview that can reach a diverse audience both here in Aotearoa New Zealand, but also in the States. 
    </p>
<p>I know that I have listeners in a few other Anglophone countries as well. Not a lot! We don't have, we're not a massive enterprise here. I don't have a lot of money and time to spend on marketing.
    So we're not a big enterprise, but I'd like to think that we're working on creating an enriched community here via <cite>Pod Uni</cite>.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>	
    <p>Absolutely. So not large, but diverse and rich. So given that, are there ways that you think you can improve or modify how the podcast works for its audience or audiences?</p>  
    <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
<p><strong>[<em>musing loudly </em>]</strong> Mmmmm. Mmmmmm. One thing I would <em>love</em> to do is I would love for Season 3 to be student podcasts. <strong>[<em>smiling </em>]</strong> That's what I would love. There are a few like technical, logistical&mdash;hopefully not legal&mdash;hoops that need to be jumped through in order to make that happen. But I think that's another way to reach students...to show off excellent student podcasts that have been produced in our course. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>	
    <p>There have been some great ones.</p>
    <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
    <p><strong>[<em>really excited</em>]</strong> There have been some good ones! Right? Yeah! </p>
<p>But I think also that that showing off  excellent student work also builds a wider community because the students are often plugged into...the stories that they tell on our podcasts are often quite local and they, the students, come with all different kinds of backgrounds and expertise and communities, and that's a way to, again, grow this, and enrich this, <cite>Pod Uni</cite> community because when a student podcast comes up, then they share it with their <i>whānau</i>.
  <i>Whānau</i> is the Māori word for family, right? They share it widely with their <i>whānau</i> and their friends, and it can invite another layer of people into the fold of <cite>Pod Uni</cite>. So I think that's one place I'd like to grow the podcast directly for audience reasons.</p>    
    <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>	
    <p>That sounds great. I think that'd be really interesting to hear those. And I think that they...the student podcasts would also help grow the local podcasting enthusiasm.</p>
    <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
    <p>Totally. I always learn stuff from our student podcasts, right? <strong>[<em>laughs</em>]</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>	
    <p><strong>[<em>smiling</em>]</strong> Yeah, me too.</p>
    <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
    <p>That's one of the great things about when I came here and learned the Māori word <i>ako</i>, which often gets translated into English as...<strong>[<em>pausing</em>]</strong>..."to teach or to learn," but it really does mean that bidirectional thing, right?
        It means bidirectional...that you're...<i>ako</i> is not unidirectional of me the podcast expert saying, <strong>[<em>exaggerated teaching voice </em>]</strong> "Open your brain, and I fill your brain with info." It's actually...we're also learning from our students at the same time as they're learning from us. And I love that that Māori concept of teaching and learning is always bidirectional.
        And I think that's <em>emblematic</em> of what we have in this podcasting class.</p>
        <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>	
        <p>Yeah, That's so true, and two&ndash;way learning is definitely what happens, which really leads us into the next question, which is: so, can you tell me a bit more about how <cite>Pod Uni</cite> works in a pedagogical sense in the classroom, and maybe also a bit for the general public?</p>
 <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p> 
<p>Sure. So, our teaching is a kind of <i>flipped classroom</i> approach, both for the face&ndash;to&ndash;face students and for the online students, right? So flipped classroom, meaning that I ask students, we ask students, to read or listen to content ahead of time, before they come to class in the face&ndash;to&ndash;face class or before they do some activities in our online asynchronous class. They have to listen to podcasts and do some reading prior to that. Then in the classroom for face&ndash;to&ndash;face students, we're doing active activities where we're practicing how to handle a microphone, how to conduct an interview, et cetera.
    Or for the online students, after they do those listenings and readings, they're doing some activities about how to set up their home studio, et cetera, with whatever microphone they have.</p>
    <p>This flipped classroom approach, <cite>Pod Uni</cite> fits that nicely, right? What we do is we create a <cite>Spotify</cite> playlist every year.
        I gave in to <cite>Spotify</cite> because that's where most of our students go to listen to podcasts. So every year I create a playlist, and it has a mix of <cite>Pod Uni</cite> podcasts as well as other podcasts, often audio documentary, cause that's what we're teaching; the course is narrative nonfiction audio documentary.
        And students can download that playlist and listen, week by week, to the content. And so then they come in to class, ostensibly, prepared having listened to that content ahead of time. I've also heard students say that when they know that they're going to an interview...so like they're in the car driving to their mate's house, or they're on the train down to go visit grandma, and they're interviewing grandma for their podcast...that they'll listen to the interview episode. Or when they're writing their narration, they'll go back and listen to the narration episode as ways of refreshing themselves.
        So ways to go back and refer again as a kind of resource. And again, I think that kind of audio&ndash;on&ndash;demand lends itself to that.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>	
        <p>It really does.</p>
        <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
        <p>Yeah, as for the second general public audience, because it is pedagogical, I think for our kind of podcast&ndash;curious listenership, it's a little...I don't have a lot of data on how other members of the public are using this, but I think what I do know is that when I do talk to people who listen to the podcast <strong>[<em>nostalgic chuckle</em>]</strong> I often take notes on things that they want to know more about, that they're curious to learn about, and then I try to line those up for future episodes. So Melissa, you've recorded an interview with me for this episode about how to do audiobooks and the differences and similarities between audiobook recording and podcasting. That was born out of a question that I got from a listener, and I thought, <strong>[<em>exaggeratedly befuddled voice</em>]</strong> "I don't know about audiobooks. I better go ask somebody who does." <strong>[<em>laughs</em>]</strong></p>
        <p>So I guess in that way, I'm constantly trying to hear the podcast through the ears of our listeners, whether they're students or general public, and trying to find ways to meet their needs. I think it's trying to instruct, yes, both our students and the general public, but also I think there's...I don't know if there's an entertainment element...
            I don't think I'm funny or anything like that, but I do think there is, in terms of getting interviews, people like Luce Blakiston and others who have name recognition. I do think there is a kind of, at least name recognition, a lot of the New Zealand podcasters have name recognition in this country; I do think that's another way of helping the general kind of podcast&ndash;curious audience get a sense of what is it like to be a professional podcaster in this country?
            What does it take? And it offers that perspective to them.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>	
            <p>That's really useful. So I think that there's a third audience here which you haven't discussed, which is <strong>[<em>pauses</em>]</strong> ourselves.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
            <p><strong>[<em>intrigued</em>]</strong> Ooh. Yes, tell me more.</p>
            <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
            <p>Well, I know that for myself going into teaching the podcasting course every year, I will relisten to the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> episodes just to refresh my memory of what it is that we want the students to take away and what we're telling them.</p>
            <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
            <p>Yes, I do. I do the same when I'm teaching the face&ndash;to&ndash;face one. So my commute to campus is a 12&ndash;minute walk, which I feel very grateful to get to have that commute. And oftentimes, I'll walk a little bit slower so I can listen to the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> episode on the way to campus that day so that I'm fully prepared for, if the lecture is on interview technique or narration, I'll listen to that episode as prep.
                So yes, I agree. We're also composing for ourselves. And honestly, I think that's...one of the joys of doing the interviews, too...is <em>I'm learning</em> as much as I hope our listeners are by doing this podcast and conducting interviews on topics that I don't know enough about.
                So bring in an expert.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>	
                <p>That makes a lot of sense.</p>
                <p>So, thinking about experts, as a rhetorician yourself, could you tell us about Seasons 1 and 2 of <cite>Pod Uni</cite> through the lens of rhetoric?</p>
            <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>  
<p>Yes. So Season 1, as I said earlier, is <i>monopod</i>. Monopod means it's just me speaking into the mic, not dialogic.
    I do think podcasting is a dialogic medium, so I don't think monopod is necessarily making the most of it, but that's why you and I are doing a dialogue here. But I do think monopod can be instructive for these very how&ndash;to podcasts. So Season 1 is how to do narration, how to do interview technique, how to do story structure, how to do sound design.
    And I was already planning on doing those prior to Covid, but then Covid hit. <strong>[<em>chuckles</em>]</strong> And I think that those came in very helpful as a kind of short, as abbreviated and focused, mini lectures, let's say 18&ndash;minute lectures on each one of these topics. But I hope that they're not just instructing on technique.
    I hope they're also inspiring. I hope they also give space for listeners to imagine themselves conducting an interview with confidence or going into vocal delivery, which many people are quite nervous about, with some kind of understanding of how their bodies, their breath, and their voice can come together to really represent who they are.
    So I <em>hope</em> that they're designed rhetorically to both instruct and to inspire. 
    </p>
<p>As for Season 2, which is a collection of interviews with experts. It's quite diverse. The first thing to say is that I didn't limit it to just podcasters. I think this is maybe the rhetorician in me.
    Rhetoricians are often&mdash;and I would say that you yourself too, Melissa&mdash;we wear many hats. We contain multitudes, right? <strong>[<em>both laugh</em>]</strong> And I think that what I was thinking when I was thinking about who to interview, I thought, "Oh, it's quite narrow if I just interview people who do podcasting."
    Whereas, like when I interviewed Whiti Hereaka&mdash;who is my super smart creative writing colleague here, who won an award for her awesome novel, <cite>Kurangaituku</cite>&mdash;I thought I want to interview her on storytelling. She's an impressive storyteller. She's also written for the stage. So she knows how to write for the ear. Actually, I thought her novel sounded like it was written for the ear.
    So I thought, I think that an interview like that...she's not a podcaster, but I think that can inform how we do podcasting, how we think about writing for the ear, how we think about storytelling. And so I take quite a capacious approach to the interviews on Season 2 cause I think that's valuable to think widely about the many different techniques and skill sets that inform podcasting, not just to think narrowly in terms of who is and is not a podcaster.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
<p>That makes a lot of sense. I like the way that the first season is, as you say, narrow and instructive. Narrow is my word. <strong>[<em>chuckles</em>]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I think that's appropriate. </p>
<p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
<p>Yeah and you've really broadened that out in Season 2 into that much wider net of first going from the dialogic monopod to dialogic, and then also getting a range of interviewees.
    I think that's quite useful. Also for students to listen to as a way of showing that they don't have to do the just one style of podcast, or there's only one type of person to interview. There are many opportunities.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
<p>That's right. That's something we emphasize in the course is that we're constantly showing students different ways of storytelling, vocal delivery, et cetera. What we're NOT trying to do in this course is reproduce a lot of the problematic things <strong>[<em>Melissa chuckles</em>]</strong> that radio has been guilty of for a long time, which is like making everyone sound like a white dude, right? <strong>[<em>Melissa audibly affirms</em>]</strong> Like those kinds of things. So we're being capacious in how we teach the course. But I think also, yeah, I hope that the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> podcast is also capacious. I think there's still room to expand some more.
</p>
<p>Yeah, but it's nascent, let's say. Like, when did the podcast come out? We've been doing it for three&ndash;ish years now. And of course, <em>teaching</em> podcasting is part of my job, but <em>producing</em> a podcast is not explicitly a part of my job, even though it is a pedagogical tool.
    I would love to get some funding. I think one way that the podcast could grow is getting some funding to bring more people into the fold of the production side of things...to grow it and get more heads in on the future directions of this so that, yeah, so that it can be more community driven, I guess.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
    <p>Yeah, a lot of podcasts do have a full team behind them, although there are also plenty of solo podcasts as well. So what sort of things would you like to see in future seasons?</p>
    <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
    <p>Mm. So I've already talked about a Season 3 of student podcasts. I think that would be really exciting. 
        I'd love to work more on creating community. I think that's one of the joys of doing the Season 2 interviews, is that it also introduces students in our course to the brilliant collection of creatives here in Aotearoa New Zealand; it expands...the people who are interviewed, then they get an expanded audience because our listeners are now exposed to their work.
        So there's a way in which&mdash;this is one thing I like about podcasts&mdash;when you go on each other's podcasts, you're kind of amplifying the whole community, in this case of podcasters or storytellers, by bringing people on. 
        </p>
<p>Where else would I like to go? I'd like, I think, yeah, to get some external funding. We've already, one thing we have done, I've had a student producer before. You've contributed to the production as well, and I would love to, eventually, since we teach narrative nonfiction or audio documentary, I would love to produce&mdash;it would probably require some funding&mdash;a narrative nonfiction or audio documentary style podcast, even if it's short, just like four episodes, <em>as a team with our students</em>.
    I think that would be tremendous. I think it would also require a second podcasting course. Right now, the course that you and I teach is an intro podcast course, right? It's for first&ndash;year students, nonexperts. You don't have to have any expertise in audio editing, any experience with a microphone at all.
    We teach all that to you, all the basics. But if we could get, with the redesign of the Bachelor of Communications&mdash;which is coming around the corner&mdash;if we can get an advanced podcasting course, that could be a student&ndash;driven project where they produce more than one episode. Right now, our students only produce one episode each at the end of the semester. And I think that would be a really enriching thing. And whether or not the students want to put it on the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> podcast, or create their own darn thing, I think that would be a beautiful next step for us and for our students in this course.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
<p>I really like that idea.
    I think that particularly the more driven students who've really enjoyed creating their first podcast would just embrace that possibility of making it more real, and particularly if they get to broadcast it, then that makes it...putting their voice out into the public. And actually, that was something that occurred to me while I was listening to you was: do you think that having the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> available for the asynchronous students makes you and the course more real for them because they have a voice to go with it?
</p>
<p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
<p>Mmmm, yeah, that's interesting. I think yes is the short answer. <em>Real</em> is a tricky word, but I think enriched, I might would say. <strong>[<em>Melissa chuckles</em>]</strong></p>
<p>One thing you and I love to do, I know, is give audio feedback on students’ audio submissions, and I think that we know&mdash;we both know from working on this course&mdash;that anecdotally, students respond really well to that. 
    That when they're reminded that there's another human on the other side that's listening and taking their work seriously, that they really appreciate that audio feedback. And so I think that's where actually I think that the dialogue...I think the Season 2 stuff really shows the other dimensions of me, seeing you as a producer, hearing you on the on your audiobook episode, and later on this episode, right?
    This shows, not all of the other sides of us, but some of them, right? I think my monopod can feel a little bit didactic, but...because I'm trying to be very clear in that season one monopod stuff. But I think that where we're interviewees in Season 2, or where we're doing interviewing, in Season 2, I think is, yeah, I think that gives our online students, who we never meet in person, a better sense of who we are.
    </p>
<p>Actually, that's one interesting thing to mention here. Because the majority of our students who take our podcasting course, Melissa, are online students, as you know...when I had a little&mdash;a wee bit of&mdash;funding to hire a student to produce three episodes, I deliberately wanted to hire an online student, who I had never met before <strong>[<em>Melissa audibly affirms</em>]</strong> because I wanted to make sure to give them an equal opportunity, not just privilege my face&ndash;to&ndash;face students. And so I hired a Māori student who lives up in the Waikato who was a top&ndash;notch storyteller and did a very good job on his podcast. And it was great. Like we just left audio messages on <cite>WhatsApp</cite> for each other, talking about the project.
    We had one synchronous <cite>Zoom</cite> call, but we still hadn't met each other. And so he took the course for one semester, then we worked together for two semesters after that in his editing. And finally, I was able...he came to the New Zealand Podcast Summit with me, and we copresented a little bit about <cite>Pod Uni</cite>. <strong>[<em>recalling nostalgically</em>]</strong> And the first time we met was the day of our presentation, in face&ndash;to&ndash;face.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
    <p>That's awesome.</p>
    <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
<p>I know, but I think that's one of the ways&mdash;online teaching often gets a bad rap, but I think&mdash;it can be done well. It just often takes more work for both us and for the students. And I think that this podcast is an example of that extra work, but also, I hope, the extra payoff for the students and for us.</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, that makes sense. So yeah...I'd like to think that having a voice makes people more...enriched is a good word. So thinking about what you've done so far, so where do you think <cite>Pod Uni</cite> has succeeded and where has it not really achieved what you really hoped that it would do?</p>
<p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
<p>Mm. Yeah, I think we've touched on some of these so far, but just to sum it up for our listeners: its successes and opportunities for future improvement.</p>
<p>I think, from the feedback that students have given us at the end of semester&mdash;on surveys and anecdotally&mdash;that the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> podcast does serve their needs, especially for that specific audience that I described of our students who are working jobs, et cetera. I think that it is helping to contribute to the budding New Zealand podcast community that I get to visit every year at the New Zealand Podcast Summit.
    I think that that community is becoming richer, and this podcast plays one small, very small, part in that, but I think it's a good part. It's helped me learn more about podcasting, right? Like I said, I can talk for a long time about rhetoric and audio and all the different kinds of skills that we explicitly teach in the course.
    But I've learned heaps about all the stuff that happens <em>after</em> you get a final episode recorded. What do you do in terms of marketing and money and growing audiences and building relationships with communities? And so I've learned heaps by conducting the interviews. So I think, in all of those ways, the podcast has achieved some of its early ambitions in terms of my rhetorical goals for what I was hoping it would achieve for both students and for the larger public.
    </p>
<p>I think in terms of shortcomings, I think, in terms of the larger public, <strong>[<em>earnestly</em>]</strong> I really wish this podcast...I know that there are in this country, there's quite a few many high schools have a media studies courses where students are producing content. I would <em>love</em> if <cite>Pod Uni</cite> could be useful to students in those courses and teachers in those courses.
    I haven't yet had enough time...part of, most of my time of being in this country has been during Covid. So I haven't had enough time to go out and try to build those relationships. I would love for it to have wider uptake. I would love for it to be useful to people who are doing audio composition at university in the United States.
    I know that's quite popular for our rhetoric and writing colleagues or communication colleagues. Again, I've made it, I've designed it deliberately not discipline specific. I say that in the kind of trailer episode. So I would love for it to have a wider uptake in a variety of pedagogical contexts. And I think part of that is me proselytizing it, but I think part of it is the other way around. Like I want to, I need to, go ask high school media studies teachers: "What do you need?" Here's this podcast that I’ve created, "Where does it <em>not</em> meet your needs, and how can I create a Season 3, a Season 4 that would be really useful to you pedagogically?" So I need to go have those conversations...to give this, a wider reach than just our course, right?</p>
<p>I think those are the main ways. I think I've already talked about my desire to create a second course to coproduce with students, to have a student podcast season. And I think there's also more ways, being here in Aotearoa, to have more Indigenous content, Māori and Pacific voices, interviewees.
    I've got one lined up for next year. We already talked about Whiti Hereaka, who's a Māori author. I think that...I have lots to learn about Māori culture, and Māori culture just has <em>such a strong and rich history of oral storytelling</em>, right?</p>
    <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
    <p>It really does.</p> 
    <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
    <p>It's so much to learn there! For me and for our listeners.
    So I think those are some of the ambitions for the future. </p>
    <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
    <p>So it sounds like there's been plenty of <i>ako</i> in the two&ndash;way learning sense. But there's more to be had in terms of needing feedback from different audiences as to what they need and marketing to get so that they know that you're there.</p>
    <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, yes.</p>


    <h3><strong>(45:10) Collin interviews Melissa</strong></h3>


<p>So can I flip the tables and ask you some questions, Melissa? </p>
<p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
<p><strong>[<em>chuckling</em>]</strong> Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
  <p>Cause we've been tag&ndash;teaching this course for a few years now. And you are also someone who wears many, many hats. You're a scientist with a Ph.D. You're a novelist who writes kind of cli&ndash;fi, fantasy, all kinds of rich stuff. You've won some awards for your writing. And you and I first met by teaching science communication together. So you've got a diverse background. </p>
<p>I'm curious to know: this course...even if the podcast doesn't have an overt emphasis on rhetoric, the course does. So I'm curious to know what rhetoric&mdash;as a lens for studying podcasting&mdash;has kind of offered you, since you have that different background to me?</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
<p>Sure. I have, yes, my initial degree was in science, and then I went on and specialized in genetics. So very different background. In my original training, the word rhetoric was...I'm not sure if it was ever used. <strong>[<em>chuckling</em>]</strong> Possibly because of its negative associations with political discourse.</p>
<p>So coming to understand the more academic interpretation of rhetoric, as the art of persuasion and understanding your audience and so on, has been a really useful mindset shift for me. Initially I'd taught academic writing and writing for science and writing for engineers for several years, and those subjects tend to focus on a fairly limited audience. So you know your audience from the outset. This is your audience, so this is the way you write. Perhaps the mindset isn't there in terms of dissecting the rhetoric because it's implicit. You know your audience, and so this is what you should do. So there's not the exploration of how should you do this and why should you do this and what would work best.</p>
<p>And coming at it from one of my other hats, fiction writing, climate fiction, fantasy writing, I've come at that from a very self&ndash;directed perspective. I haven't done any courses. I have done one course, but I haven't done any formal courses in creative writing. All the creative writing academics cringing and shaking their heads and going, <strong>[<em>mock chiding voice</em>]</strong> "But how did she not get rhetoric?" My apologies to them. But it's probably because it is, has been, self&ndash;directed.</p>
<p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
<p>I'm not convinced that many of the creative writers I speak to have much training in rhetoric either. Although there is quite...there's some interesting research on the rhetoric of fiction that has been done historically in our field, but I'm not sure if there's as much crossover into creative writing. That doesn't surprise me.</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
<p>I do wonder if it's again, if it's implicit rather than explicitly explained, I think it's, I think it's probably there, but not explored necessarily. Or I haven't met those people. </p>
<p>So from the perspective of fiction writing, academic writing, any sort of writing, the rhetoric really is a central component of it.
    Whether it's understood as such or not. It's been useful for me in terms of thinking about how you'll tell a story, because depending on who you are and who your audience is, what effect you want to have on your audience, so that makes a difference to all sorts of things, from your choice of topic, to the words that you use, or how long your sentences are, all of that, so understanding your audience, and where you are yourself coming from in relation to that audience is really key to understand.
    So that's been something that I've understood much more clearly as a result of doing this course. And also just through listening to all the different things that we need to know to teach the course has been a great form of <i>ako</i>.
    </p>
<p>So I wanted to touch on the critical thinking as well because I think that's one of the key things that arts and science are both really keen on saying that they do critical thinking, and they do, but in different ways.
    But critical thinking is not necessarily explicitly taught, except possibly to those in marketing for, in terms of the art of persuasion. <strong>[<em>Collin audibly affirms</em>]</strong> So that's been really useful. And given that storytelling is, at the moment, considered to be, a key way to impart information of all types, understanding rhetoric really helps with doing that successfully.
    So...if you're say doing academic writing, you're often asked to impart information in a particular way. So maybe you want to do a report on how to build a bridge or something like that. So that's for a particular audience. And understanding explicitly how that is helps you to frame your information appropriately for your audience. So...this is all taught in the course, obviously, but it's been useful for me to understand it more precisely. </p>
<p>So going back to your question, coteaching on this course and using this podcast has really helped me to shift my mindset from viewing rhetoric as something that only slimy politicians use <strong>[<em>chuckles</em>]</strong>, to considering it as more of an essential tool which a lot of us use without even knowing it.
    And moving that implicit understanding to explicit understanding is really helpful in terms of, for me, as a storyteller, but also for me to be able to verbalize that for students.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
<p>Terrific. Well, great. I'm secretly glad that you have a positive review of rhetoric. <strong>[<em>both laugh</em>]</strong> That's, yeah, that's terrific.
    That means that rhetorically, I think I've done my job. I hope so. <strong>[<em>Collin chuckles</em>]</strong></p>
<p>So tell me a little bit more about what your own experience has been teaching <cite>Pod Uni</cite> the podcast or teaching with it. Because when I asked if you wanted to coteach this with me, I had sort of already...or I was in the process of getting this up and running and then said, "Hey, here's this teaching tool."
    So I'd be curious to know a little bit more about your own experience using the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> podcast in our pedagogy.</p>
    <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
    <p>Sure. I guess the first thing is, perhaps, the most obvious thing for anyone who has taught students, is that the more motivated students are the ones who report listening to it most.</p>
    <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
    <p>That's right. I'm under no illusion that every single student listens to every episode. <strong>[<em>laughs</em>]</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
    <p>Yeah, that's inevitable. But I do think that the more practical monopod, the first series, is a really useful primer for those, especially for those who are new to producing a podcast. And I think that they do get a lot of listens, possibly only in the last few weeks when they're desperately trying to catch up to making their podcast <strong>[<em>both chuckling</em>]</strong>, but I think that they do view that as a useful resource. Because it is definitely...the more enthusiastic ones do appreciate the second series episodes as examples, and so I think actually they would <em>love</em> to have that opportunity of hearing more shorter narrative nonfiction podcasts as examples for themselves because if there's one thing I've learnt that students love to have examples.
        </p>
    <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
     <p>Yes. So you're saying if we put more student examples up as a third season, they would appreciate that? Yeah, that's right.</p>
     <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
     <p>Yeah. It's really useful for students to have the ability to listen to something on the go. Particularly those asynchronous students, the distance students who have a lot going on in their lives. If you can just plug your earpods in and listen to the podcast while you're doing other things, it's so helpful when you're trying to juggle your multiple time commitments. And I think that they appreciate that. One of the difficult things I think is that potentially the students who could do with listening to it the most don't necessarily get that listening in.
        I think that's also a perennial teaching problem. But they do, all the students, I think, listen to more podcasts by the end of the course than when they started. I know that we've had some students who have never listened to a podcast before, but by the end of the course, they've listened to a whole slew of them, and some of them have become absolutely converts to podcasting.
        So I think that the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> is part of that. So even though they might not have <cite>Pod Uni</cite> on a multiple play repeat list, they're still getting something from the course.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p> 
<p>I hope so. Yeah. Aw, that's good to hear.</p>
<p>Tell me about your experience <em>producing</em> some of the...you've produced three of the most recent episodes...<strong>[<em>Melissa laughs</em>]</strong> What's it been like to be on the back end of this pedagogical tool?</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
<p>Oh, it's been really interesting. I have so much more sympathy with the students producing their podcasts now. <strong>[<em>laughs again</em>]</strong> But useful also to view it from both sides. So to have, okay, we've got this tool that we can listen to. How does it work?
    What are the moving parts? And how do they fit together? So that's been really useful for me to, like I said, to have sympathy, but also have a better understanding of some of the challenges that student podcasters can have using different equipment, making a space more friendly for podcasting.
    So it makes me think about technical challenges and search for solutions. But it also makes me appreciate how much tools make a difference, so it's absolutely possible to make a podcast with the most basic of tools, but sometimes having better tools makes it better. <strong>[<em>laughs knowingly</em>]</strong>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, it saves time usually. And you're editing in <cite>Audacity</cite>, the free open source software. And you've had to tidy up some of my <em>less high quality audio</em>, let's say the particular...doing the live episode of the podcast at the New Zealand Podcast Summit. I think was quite the challenge for you to produce that episode.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
        <p><strong>[<em>knowingly</em>]</strong> Yeah, that was an interesting introduction to editing live.</p>
        <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
        <p>Yeah. Thank you for your <i>mahi</i> on that. <i>Mahi</i> is the Māori word for work. Yeah, appreciate the work that went into that.</p>
        <p>Yeah, and I think I feel the same way. You said that you have a more kind of sympathy or empathy for and with the students. And I totally agree.
            Every time...cause I only do these episodes every few months. I'm not doing it weekly by any stretch of the imagination. I think every time I get back into it, I go, <strong>[<em>mock surprised voice</em>]</strong> "Oh, right, this does require a lot of different things." Both the software, the listening, the microphone technique, the writing, the episode descriptions, gathering the transcripts, putting the transcripts on the website, right?
            There's a lot that goes into this work. So I always, every time I do it, I'm reminded of those challenges.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
            <p><strong>[<em>chuckling</em>]</strong> Yeah, it's a multidisciplinary task really, which is one of the things I really like about it actually, because you have different things to focus on at different times. So you've got your practical, getting the sound in the first place, then you've got editing the sound. Or actually, you're, first of all, you're academic writing, the questions, thinking about what you want to ask, doing the interview, so getting the sound, and then cleaning it up <strong>[<em>chuckles knowingly</em>]</strong>, making it sound the way you really wanted it to sound. They're all a lot of different skills that go into it. </p>
            <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
            <p>For sure. So we've already talked a little bit about some of the aspirations that I have for the future of a pedagogical tool like <cite>Pod Uni</cite>. Can you tell me what are your own visions and futures and aspirations for the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> podcast?</p>
            <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
            <p>Oh, that's a really good question. So I think that there are a lot of ways that you could go with this podcast, and I love the idea of getting the student podcasts and getting the community involved. That sounds really, really useful and like something that would have a lot of energy to it.</p>
<p>From the perspective of just teaching the course, I think it would be interesting to have some really short episodes, like five minute focus type things, for example, on some of the different tools. I mean, for example, using AI editing versus hands&ndash;on editing...the different tools that are available for podcasts.
    If you do a quick search there, you can be easily overwhelmed. So it's really good to have a short list that students can use, but it would be interesting to explore some of those possibilities.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
    <p>I like that idea of short little tech, almost like book reviews, but <em>tech reviews</em>. Like here, <strong>[<em>in a broadcasting voice</em>]</strong> "So you've heard about this software. What do we think? And how does it work?" And boom, boom, boom, just quickly...so maybe in just five minutes, you could quickly walk your audience through how a software platform or how a microphone works.</p>
    <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
    <p>Yeah. And I think that it would be useful to have it on the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> platform because that way it's part of the course, it's perceived as part of it, and you don't have to go searching and get random stuff that you have no idea of the provenance.
        So that would be...I think that would be interesting. It might take a lot of work, mind you. 
        </p>
<p>And so that sort of relates to the other thing that I thought about, which is...it would be interesting to talk to someone about producing podcasts of different lengths for different audiences because you have talked to a lot of different people in Episode 2, and those tend to be longer form podcasts.</p>
<p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
<p>In Season 2.</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
<p>Sorry, Season 2, not Episode 2. <strong>[<em>chuckles</em>]</strong> Yeah, so those tend to be longer form podcasts, and the students themselves in the course have to produce quite a short podcast, and it'd be interesting to have some reflection on like how those work for different audiences, like podcasts for kids versus podcasts for teens or older listeners.
</p>
<p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
<p>So that's something I've been thinking about because I did do a course on how to produce podcasts for like preschoolers for science, teaching science to kids. </p>
<p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
<p>And I think that's a growing market, too. Yeah, you're...I know that you've written for young adults and you've maybe also written, you've done music for kids as well, is that right?</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, my sister does the music, and I do the activities, the science information and activities, and we do want to turn that into a podcast.</p>
<p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
<p>Terrific. Yeah, that would be...I think that's a great audience to think about content for. And I don't know...yeah, I would love to speak to some experts on producing for kids cause I think that's a really interesting idea. And also, like you say, producing shorter episodes, which is a different thing. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, it is a very different thing and tends to attract different audiences as well.</p>
  <p>I also wonder...I would love to know how, if you, I don't know if you have any stats on this, but I'd love to know how the listen rate goes between, say, the in&ndash;person and asynchronous students.
    And I do wonder if it would be useful to incorporate some of the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> episodes as a "click here to listen to this." For the students who are working through it at a laptop or a desk at a computer rather than doing things at the same time. 
    </p>
<p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
<p><strong>[<em>thinking out loud</em>]</strong> Embedded in the LMS, the Learning Management System.
    That's a good idea. I like that idea a lot. 
    </p>
    <p>Yeah. I don't have any data on the face&ndash;to&ndash;face students versus the online students in terms of who listens. It's not...I don't get that <em>granular</em> of data. But I think you're right to say that, as much as we hear feedback from students that it's really useful to listen while they're on the move, commuting and making dinner or whatever, that actually plenty of students prefer to just sit down at the computer, carve out an hour and a half and work through stuff and making sure that the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> podcast is also embedded in that environment in the LMS gives it more <em>visibility</em>, which is not always a term that we use when we're talking about audio podcasting.
        I like that.
        </p>
<p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, so those are the two main things that occurred to me when I was thinking about this. I think it would be just interesting to see how that affected uptake because I know it's quite hard to tell if somebody has listened to something or not when it's on their <cite>Spotify</cite> playlist.
    You'll get a number of listens, but not necessarily specific to who those people were. </p>
<p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Well, <i>kia ora</i>, Melissa. Thank you for all of that. </p>
<p>For our non&ndash;Kiwi listeners, <i>kia ora</i> can also be something you say at the end of a conversation, as a kind of gratitude for the conversation that we just had.</p>
<p>So thank you for taking the time today, Melissa! </p>
  <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
  <p>Kia ora, Collin.</p>
  <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
  <p>I've certainly learned from this conversation. I hope that our listeners also learn from this conversation. And yeah, I look forward to seeing where we go next with the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> Podcast.</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>

<p><strong>[<em>smiling</em>]</strong> <i>Ngā mihi nui</i>! That means <em>thanks a lot</em>...in Māori.</p>
