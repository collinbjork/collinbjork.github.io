                <h2>Introduction</h2>
              </header>
<p>In rhetoric and writing studies, much of the scholarship about podcasting is pedagogical scholarship. Researchers have investigated using podcasts as teaching tools to expand the five canons of rhetoric (Jennifer Bowie, 2012), to develop multimodal listening habits (Steph Ceraso, 2018), to highlight embodied writing practices (Jeremy Cushman &amp; Shannon Kelly, 2018), to rethink ancient rhetorical exercises (Eric Detweiler, 2019), to affect social change (Philip Choong & Collin Bjork, 2023), and to augment students’ rhetorical awareness (Alison Klein, 2020). This scholarship emerged from a much longer disciplinary tradition of research about the intersection between sound and writing. A 2006 special issue of <cite>Computers and Composition</cite>cite> titled “Sound in/as Composition Space,” co&ndash;edited by Cheryl Ball and Byron Hawk, illustrated how teacher&ndash;scholars interested in digital writing and rhetoric have been focused investigated “other modes of meaning including audio (p. 263) for over two decades. That collection included studies of hip&ndash;hop sampling as audio composition (Mickey Hess, 2006), non&ndash;diegetic music in film (Bump Halbritter, 2006), and the sonic elements of poetic webtexts (Heidi McKee, 2006). Early research like this established soundwriting as an important site for rhetorical inquiry, and it didn’t take long for a wider swathe of teacher&ndash;scholars to begin experimenting with using sound in the composition classroom. </p>
<p>In a seminal text about soundwriting, Cynthia Selfe (2009) summarized key moments in the history of aural composing and examined its uptake, or lack thereof, in 150 years of American university&ndash;level writing instruction. She concluded that the field’s emphasis on alphabetic composition limits students’ rhetorical resources for meaning making and, by contrast, that by including aurality in composition instruction, “we expand the field of play for students” (p. 644). Among the many teacher&ndash;scholars who answered Selfe’s call to take up more multimodal composition with an emphasis on sound, Kyle D. Stedman’s edited collections with Courtney S. Danforth and Michael J. Faris stand out for the breadth, depth, and diversity of their contributions (Danforth, Stedman, & Faris, 2018; Stedman, Danforth, & Faris, 2021; Faris, Danforth, & Stedman, 2022). These collections explicitly connect to theories and practices of composition pedagogy to sonic rhetorics and offer writing teachers an inspiring array of teaching strategies for navigating soundwriting and deafness (Jennifer J. Buckner & Kirsten Daley, 2018), sound writing as critical resistance to racial oppression (Michael Burns, et al., 2018), sound mixing as rhetorical practice (Mathew Gomes, 2021), writing with hip&ndash;hop music (Todd Craig, 2022), and oral histories as composition (Janice W. Fernheimer, 2022). They also intersect with recent research in <cite>Kairos</cite> about the Canadian mixtape as soundwriting pedagogy (Rich Shivener, et al., 2021) and “extracurricular soundwriting pedagogy” aimed at institutional change (Jennifer Sano&ndash;Franchini, et al., 2021). Yet despite the richness of the research on soundwriting and podcasting pedagogies, much of it focuses on face&ndash;to&ndash;face teaching, not online learning.</p>
<p>At the same time, the rapid development of online writing instruction (OWI) scholarship has provided a wealth of insights to online teachers (Scott J. Warnock, 2009; Beth L. Hewett & Kevin Eric Depew, 2015a; Dahlia Han, Melissa Gunn, & Rachel Chidlow, 2017; Rich Rice & Kirk St. Amant, 2018; Collin Bjork, 2018; Jesse Borgman & Casey McArdle, 2019; Beth L. Hewett, Tiffany Bourelle, & Scott J. Warnock, 2021; Rochelle Rodrigo & Catrina Mitchum, 2024; Cat Mahaffey & Ashlyn Walden, 2025). Like podcasting pedagogy research, today’s online writing instruction scholarship builds on a long line scholarship about teaching composition, including multimodal composition, in mediated and online environments. After all, the very first issue of <cite>Kairos</cite> examined online writing labs (OWLs), asking how this form of pedagogy impacts ESL students (Suzan Moody, 1996), literacy (J. Paul Johnson, 1996), and writing instruction writ large (Stuart Blythe, 1996). A decade later, a special issue of <cite>Computers and Composition</cite> titled “Distance Learning: Evolving Perspectives,” edited by Jane Blakelock and Tracy E. Smith (2006), augmented this field and included some articles that paid special attention to the politics of online writing instruction (Kristine Blair & Cheryl Hoy, 2006; Colleen A. Reilly & Joseph John Williams, 2006). Today, the OWI Community, the Global Society of Online Literacy Educators (GSOLE), the members of the CCCC OWI Committee, and hundreds of instructors around the globe have built a substantial body of collective knowledge about online writing instruction. </p>
<p>Among this scholarship, <cite>Multimedia in the College Classroom</cite> by Heidi Skurat Harris & Michael Greer (2024) stands out for highlighting the importance of incorporating multimedia in OWI. They explained that “[t]he assumption that online course design is text&ndash;driven is so prevalent that it is almost invisible” (p. 9). Their research drew heavily on educational psychologist Richard E. Mayer who primarily understands multimedia as communication that contains both words and images. As such, their book emphasized the visual elements of online writing instruction more than the sonic dimensions of teaching composition online. This focus on the textual, and now the visual, elements of online writing instruction illuminates how the field has yet to fully explore its connections with sonic rhetorics and soundwriting pedagogies. Conversely, the sub&ndash;discipline of soundwriting pedagogies can augment its body of research by further investigating how its practices function in the context of hybrid and online learning environments. This webtext aims to link and extend these bodies of scholarship by asking: <em>how might a pedagogical podcast contribute to online writing instruction?</em> </p>			
<p>First, some definitions. In this webtext, we follow the CCCC OWI Committee in defining online writing instruction as:</p>
<p><blockquote>writing instruction that occurs&mdash;at least partially if not fully&mdash;in a computer&ndash;based, Internet, or intranet instructional setting. It uses online/digital media to provide instruction; to talk about writing; or to distribute, share, and/or collect writing&ndash;related materials. OWI can occur in either the synchronous or asynchronous modality using a variety of electronic media, platforms, and technologies. (Hewett and Depew, 2015b, p. 2)
</blockquote></p>
<p>This definition is, as Hewett and Depew reiterated, “inclusive of both the hybrid and the fully online settings” (2015b, p. 10). Such a fluid definition of online writing instruction suits our own institutional context in which we simultaneously teach both hybrid and fully&ndash;online versions of our podcasting course, which is taught through the lens of multimodal composition. </p>				
<p>We also need to define a <em>pedagogical podcast</em> and identify the points of convergence and divergence between pedagogical podcasts and their near cousin, educational podcasts. In his taxonomy of podcast genres, Eric Detweiler (2021) defines educational podcasts as a genre that “typically revolves around one person, or occasionally more than one, offering information or instruction to listeners.” Pedagogical podcasts, in our view, are a kind of educational podcast that focuses not just on broadly informing or instructing listeners but also, like a textbook, operates as an explicit part of the course design. While many podcasts are educational, a podcast becomes explicitly pedagogical when instructors incorporate it into a carefully designed set of instructional materials. As with many podcast genres, the lines between educational and pedagogical podcasts are fluid. For instance, an educational podcast such as <cite>Ted Talks Daily</cite> may become a pedagogical podcast when an instructor assigns an episode in one of their courses. Conversely, a pedagogical podcast that is created specifically as a classroom resource like a textbook, becomes part of the larger collection of educational podcasts when wider publics&mdash;beyond the students in course it is designed for&mdash;listen to and learn from its episodes. Pedagogical podcasts can be used in online, hybrid, or face&ndash;to&ndash;face instructional environments. </p>
<p>We know that instructors in rhetoric and writing studies have long been using podcast episodes in their pedagogies. But we also know that it is less common to create a new podcast for a specific course, especially when so many instructors in our discipline teach in limited and precarious positions. So we decided to create a pedagogical podcast and to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of incorporating it into our hybrid and online podcasting course. This webtext reflects on nearly four years of producing and teaching a pedagogical podcast called <cite>Pod Uni</cite> for use in online and hybrid versions of a podcasting course at a large public university in Aotearoa New Zealand. Based on our initial observations, we argue that a pedagogical podcast can bolster existing online writing instruction pedagogies especially when teaching multimodal composition, but that creating a pedagogical podcast also places notable&mdash;and in some cases untenable&mdash;demands on online writing instructors’ time, labor, and privacy. </p>

              <h2>Context</h2>
            </header>
<p>In 2021, Collin Bjork launched <cite>Pod Uni</cite>, an audio&ndash;only pedagogical podcast about podcasting. We use this podcast to teach a podcasting course, which is offered in both hybrid and online asynchronous modes (although the vast majority of students take the online version). This podcasting course functions as a digital writing and rhetoric course where students learn rhetorical techniques and audio writing strategies to compose a single narrative nonfiction, or audio documentary, episode of a podcast. The publicly available <cite>Pod Uni</cite> podcast is also informed by rhetorical principles, although, as Dr. Bjork explains later, the rhetorical elements of the podcast are often disguised with the hope that the podcast may have a wider disciplinary reach beyond rhetoric and writing courses. </p>
<p>We teach at Te Kunenga ki Pūrehuroa Massey University in Aotearoa New Zealand. Our university has been engaged in distance education for over sixty years and online education for over twenty years. In the past several years, the majority of our humanities students have been online students. Most of Aotearoa’s universities are located in the country’s larger and more expensive cities, which can be prohibitively expensive for many students. Our online courses make a university education accessible to students who live outside of these urban centers as well as to students who work full&ndash;time, have caretaking duties, and/or have disabilities that make face&ndash;to&ndash;face courses extra challenging. To accommodate students’ busy work and family commitments, our online podcasting course, like many others at our institution, is primarily asynchronous. We offer a handful of optional Zoom sessions that are only lightly attended, but otherwise our course is fully delivered through the learning management system and the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> podcast. The hybrid version of this same course requires students to do a few hours of independent work, including listening to episodes of the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> podcast, prior to a two&ndash;hour tutorial session offered once a week. While it is possible that a pedagogical podcast could also work in face&ndash;to&ndash;face composition courses, we have only tested its use in hybrid and fully online courses, which is our focus here. </p>
<p>The students who take our rhetorically&ndash;informed podcasting course in both online and hybrid versions are relatively diverse. The hybrid students tend to be younger, most just out of high school; while the fully online students are on average several years older, often working professionals and young parents. In terms of race, both hybrid and online cohorts tend to roughly mirror racial diversity of the larger nation, which is to say predominantly white (or “New Zealand European,” as the government terms it) with sizable minorities of Asian, Māori, and Pacific Islander students. Typically very few international students take our course. Each year, we have online students who take our course from Australia and sometimes from other nations too. But these overseas students are all New Zealanders who are working overseas and who choose to study online at Massey University because they get cheaper tuition&mdash;what Americans would call “in&ndash;state” tuition&mdash;than they would if they paid international student rates to study in the country where they live. Thus, while our online students sometimes take our course from a variety of different worldwide locales, those students usually identify as Kiwis and represent roughly the same racial diversity as the domestic students. Given this similarity in our overseas and domestic student cohorts, we typically have fewer “friction points” (Kirk St. Amant, 2013) when teaching our overseas students than other online instructors who teach students across more marked cultural and national boundaries. For us, the primary friction point that our overseas students face is what Rich Rice and Kirk St. Amant called “connecting” in their “3Cs of writing in global online contexts” (2018, p. 8). Because our overseas students typically work full&ndash;time and live in different time zones than New Zealand Standard Time, we sometimes struggle to connect “in ways that build a continually interacting community around a shared area of interest” (p. 8). As we discuss in the subsequent sections, the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> podcast does not fully resolve this friction point, but it does offer another opportunity for  connection to our overseas and online students. </p>			  
<p>In our online and hybrid podcasting courses, we use the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> podcast as a kind of audio textbook. In a typical week, we assign for homework one episode from <cite>Pod Uni</cite> that pertains to that week’s focus. As with textbook readings or instructional videos, students are asked to reflect on and/or take notes on the episode and then to apply their learnings in a series of exercises or activities. In the hybrid version of the course, these activities are done collectively during the two&ndash;hour class session. In the asynchronous online version of the course, students complete these exercises independently and submit their work online, sometimes for collective discussion and sometimes for private feedback from the instructor. </p>	
<p>This webtext does not, however, discuss the specific learning activities or assignments that students complete during the course. Instead, this webtext focuses on the broad implications of what we learned from designing and deploying the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> podcast in our online and hybrid course. Thus, unlike many other valuable <cite></cite>PraxisWiki</cite> articles in <cite>Kairos</cite>, this webtext does not analyze the nuances of syllabus design, specific assignments, or examples of student work because we found that the consequences of creating a pedagogical podcast for OWI reached well beyond individual learning activities and touched on some of the most pressing concerns in our discipline, including the growth of online learning, contingent labor issues, and our collective efforts to refine rhetorically sound digital pedagogies. </p>			  

			  <h2>Podcasting&ndash;as&ndash;Scholarship</h2>
			  
<p>Rhetoric, podcasting, and teaching are all dialogic forms of engagement, so in the remainder of this webtext we offer a series of dialogic reflections on our online podcasting pedagogies, presented as short audio recordings or mini podcast episodes. These audio recordings are part of a yet&ndash;to&ndash;be&ndash;released full&ndash;length episode of <cite>Pod Uni</cite> where we provide our students, and the wider public, with a behind&ndash;the&ndash;scenes look at the rhetorical decisions that go into composing a pedagogical podcast like this. We created this episode as a meta&ndash;reflection that models and makes visible&mdash;for both our students and for other educators who listen to the podcast&mdash;the rhetorical decision&ndash;making that went into crafting a pedagogical podcast. For this webtext, we have selected the most relevant parts of that episode to include here, and for each audio clip, we have highlighted specific takeaways that pertain to using a pedagogical podcast in OWI. We also include in this webtext the first two episodes of <cite>Pod Uni</cite> (only 2&ndash;minutes each) to provide important context for <cite>Kairos</cite> readers about the rhetorical and cultural context of Pod Uni. And of course, we provide a transcript for these audio recordings&mdash;as we do in Pod Uni&mdash;for accessibility. </p>			  
<p>As a compilation of short podcast episodes and audio compositions, this webtext also extends a larger transdisciplinary conversation about podcasting as scholarship. Researchers in rhetoric and writing studies have long challenged normative assumptions about the form, shape, and sound of scholarship. <cite>Kairos</cite> has produced a long line of webtexts that illustrate the different possibilities of audio&ndash;as&ndash;scholarship: Janine Butler (2016), Crystal VanKooten (2016), José Manuel Flores and Lucía Durá (2021), Karrieann Soto Vega and Steven Hammer (2021), Jonathon W. Stone (2021), A.D. Carson (2021), Hannah McGregor and Stacey Copeland (2022), and Kyle D. Stedman (2024). <cite>Enculturation</cite> has also played an important role in laying the groundwork for audio–as–scholarship through its <cite>Sonic Projects Archive</cite> and <cite>Intermezzo</cite> texts such <cite>Tuning in to Soundwriting</cite> (Kyle D. Stedman, Courtney Danforth, & Michael J. Faris, 2021) and <cite>Sound Never Tasted So Good</cite> (Steph Ceraso, 2019). So too has the <cite>Journal of Multimodal Rhetorics</cite> (e.g. Steven Hammer & Greg Sieber, 2019; Karrieann Soto Vega, 2019; Abigail Lambke, 2019). Additionally, disciplinary podcasts such as <cite>Rhetoricity</cite>, <cite>Pedagogue</cite>, <cite>The Big Rhetorical Podcast</cite>, <cite>Global Rhetorics</cite>, <cite>Everyone’s Writing with AI (Except Me)</cite>, <cite>Kairoscast</cite>, and many others also have played an important role in the larger research ecosystem of rhetoric and writing studies. In sum, rhetoric and composition has a rich history of audio scholarship, and this webtext extends this storied scholarly tradition by incorporating a podcast into a webtext that investigates the role of podcasting in online writing pedagogies. This webtext is thus both an extension of <cite>Pod Uni</cite> and a critical inquiry into its potential for rhetorical pedagogies in online environments. </p>

<p>Kia ora, my name is Collin Bjork. I am the host of <cite>Pod Uni</cite>, the podcast about podcasting. The goal of this podcast is to help you learn how to create your own podcast and also to help you learn how to think critically about the podcasts that we listen to. </p>
<p>I like to think of this podcast as a kind of textbook but not as heavy and hopefully a lot more fun. It will feature sometimes me speaking directly to you about podcast production techniques. Other times, I'll be speaking with experts and smart people in the field about other podcasting issues. But like any good textbook, don't listen to this podcast in order. Skip around. Listen to the episodes that interest you. </p>
<p>This podcast is produced here in Aotearoa New Zealand, so I often use te reo Māori or Māori language words like "kia ora." The Māori are the tangata whenua of Aotearoa New Zealand, the people of the land, the first inhabitants of these islands. And my efforts to use Māori language are not just a recognition of the land on which I produce this podcast; they're also an acknowledgement of the rich and storied history of kōrero, of the speech history of Māori culture. </p>
<p>Ultimately, I hope that this podcast is for anyone who's interested in podcasting. I especially hope it's useful for teachers across a variety of disciplines and levels. I hope it's useful for university lecturers and high schoolers and even primary school. I hope it's useful for communication and media classes, rhetoric and writing classes, literature and culture classes. I've deliberately not applied a disciplinary lens to this podcast so that you might find episodes that are useful to you, include them in your courses, and then apply your own disciplinary lens on top of it. Thanks for listening!</p>

<p></p>
<p>Kia ora, my name is Collin Bjork. My family is from Texas. I live now here in Palmerston North Aotearoa New Zealand, and this is the podcast about podcasting.</p>
<p></p>	
<p>We begin with a karakia, with a chant, from Māori culture about "tuhia," which is related to the word "tuhituhi" (to write). But this notion of tuhia or tuhituhi predates European notions of writing. Indeed, tuhituhi might be more like something like to inscribe or to make one's mark on the world or to make one's mark, as the karakia says, on the sky, the land, and the hearts of the people. Indeed, podcasting is this opportunity to mark the world and the hearts of others through our kōrero, through our speech, and indeed to be marked in return through the kōrero of others. This is what the podcasting and the karakia attunes our energies to. The next part of the karakia says ko te mea nui, ko te aroha: "the most important thing is love," (the aroha). Now it might sound wild to western ears to think of podcasting as aroha, as love, but indeed, to show compassion, to listen carefully with empathy&mdash;not an interrogation, not an extraction, but a careful listening, a true dialogue&mdash;this is the opportunity to show aroha, to show love. And indeed, then, we can haumi e, hui e taiki e, we can bind it and stitch it together; stitch together our communities, our dialogue, ourselves, our world. This is what the karakia orients ourselves to. This is why we open a podcast about podcasting with "tuhia ki te rangi," the karakia. Thanks for listening! Kia ora.</p>

<p>This section uses a combination of audio clips and textual discussion to describe four major takeaways that emerged from creating this pedagogical podcast and including it in our online pedagogy. We synthesize and reflect on these takeaways as a whole in the final section of this webtext.</p> 

			  
			  <h3><strong>Takeaway 1</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>A pedagogical podcast is a medium&ndash;appropriate way to meet some of the needs of online students in a multimodal composition course.</strong></h4>

<p>So <cite>Pod Uni</cite> is a teaching tool or pedagogical tool. Could you tell me a bit about the origin story of the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> podcast, particularly thinking about rhetoric?</p>        	  
<p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>	
<p>Sure thing. So I taught podcasting in the States while I was working on my Ph.D., and then I moved to Aotearoa New Zealand.
    <i>Aotearoa</i> is the Indigenous name for New Zealand. And I had the chance to design a podcasting course here, which I was quite excited about. So I started working on the design in 2019 and 2020 prior to the pandemic. And one of the unique things about teaching at Massey University is that we teach many of our classes in both face&ndash;to&ndash;face and online modes.
    So we will have online students from all around Aotearoa New Zealand, and sometimes overseas, Australia...actually my first semester at Massey, I taught students on six of seven continents. And since then I've actually taught a firefighter in Antarctica. So it's a very unique teaching environment here at Massey.
    </p> 	  
    <p>And I was trying to think of ways to make sure that the podcasting course I was designing would suit online students as well as face&ndash;to&ndash;face students. And I remember my partner said, <strong>[<em>in a voice that knows it's asking a leading question</em>]</strong> "Hey, are you going to teach podcasting <em>via podcast?</em>" <strong>[<em>laughs</em>]</strong> And she said that to me while I was walking out the door one day to go to the university. And then at the university, one of the administrators I work with asked me the <em>same</em> question that same day, and I thought, okay, this is...this is... a brilliant idea that I can't take credit for, thanks to my partner and to our admin here. But I thought that was a fruitful way of reaching our online students...one that is medium appropriate, right? It's an audio pedagogical medium for teaching audio production and audio cultures and listening. And it's also a way that meets our online students’ needs. Because many of our online students are working professionals, they're working full time, they're parents, they're caretakers, they're commuting to and from work.
        And so podcasting is actually a useful medium. We're talking about only audio podcasting in <cite>Pod Uni</cite>, although I do upload videos to <cite>YouTube</cite> with still images. But it's a mode of teaching that I think suits our online students very well. And actually, we give the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> episodes to the internal students as well.
        So this was the origin of it. And it's important too, because our online teaching is <em>asynchronous</em>. So we're not having synchronous zoom sessions with our students, although you and I&mdash;we both teach this course together&mdash;have since added a synchronous Zoom session once a month around the major assignments in the course. 
        But really, we're mostly asynchronous. And so this podcast is a way to get some content, some knowledge, some skills development to the online students.                 
        </p>
<p>Now, there are two things I was thinking about when I was approaching this from a rhetorical lens, right? So I'm thinking, "Okay, I'm creating a podcast. Who is my audience?"
    And I already told you some of the student audience, but I also thought, wouldn't it be cool if this is a public facing tool, if it's not just a textbook that's inside the four walls of my classroom. It's public, publicly accessible out there. <em>Who else might find this useful?</em> So I wanted to make it nondiscipline specific.
    I love rhetoric and would be happy to proselytize rhetoric to everybody, but I wanted it to be able to be taken up, for example, in <em>high school</em> media studies classes, to be taken up in intermediate school classes, or even primary school...I wanted it to be able to be taken up in a workplace environment, for example. Any place where people would find this information about how to podcast, how to think about podcast cultures and production useful, I wanted it to be able to be taken up. So I deliberately did not foreground a rhetorical lens. 
    </p>	
<p> That being said, the second thing is: <strong>[<em>smiling</em>]</strong> I'm a rhetorician; I can't help but <em>smuggle</em> the rhetoric in there. For me, a lot of the episodes are foregrounding questions of audience, which has historically been important to rhetoric.
    It's asking listeners to think carefully about who their listeners are and to not think of their listeners as homogenous, but actually as quite diverse, and how do you speak to those diverse audiences? And when I'm talking about interviews, or conducting interviews with other podcasters, I'm always thinking of myself as a <em>surrogate for my listeners</em>, right?
    I'm imagining what kind of questions do my listeners want to know? Some of them are students. Some of them are not university students. And what are they likely to want to know out of my interviews? So those are, that's the origin story, and that's sort of some of the design elements that went into my initial thinking about the podcast. </p>
<p>Yeah, and I should say too, just to clarify, right now the podcast has two seasons. The first season is monopod, where it's me giving a few episodes of <em>how&ndash;to</em> podcasts, each one about a different topic...about narration, about vocal delivery, about sound design, et cetera.
    And the second season is a bunch of interviews with podcasting experts or storytelling experts from around Aotearoa New Zealand.

    <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>	
    <p>Could you tell us a bit about <cite>Pod Uni</cite>'s audience as you see it now? So do you want to say some more about the initial audience?
        </p>  
        <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>	
<p>Yeah, so, the audience for the podcast is diverse, right?
    So I think of at least two audiences for the podcast. And the initial audience that I was designing for was my students. So this is primarily a pedagogical tool; it's a rhetorical tool that I'm designing to teach. Our podcasting course does teach some rhetorical principles explicitly in the course and in terms of asking students to think about when they're producing their podcast or listening to podcasts, who are the audiences, what is the cultural context, et cetera.
    So our students are getting that wraparound rhetorical content in the course, even if the podcast isn't explicitly foregrounding it. 
    </p> 
<p>So who is the audience for the podcast <cite>Pod Uni</cite>? Our students are quite diverse, right? Our Massey University students are primarily Kiwis, but they're not always.
    We have <em>international</em> students. Some of our Kiwi students are working overseas, as I said in my first answer. Many of them live and work in Australia. Many of our students, whether they're face&ndash;to&ndash;face students or online students, are Indigenous students, right? So Māori are the Indigenous peoples of Aotearoa New Zealand.
    And also there are many Pacific Indigenous students from Tonga and Samoa who take our courses...up to around 30 percent, give or take, every semester. 
    </p>
<p>And I think that's a really important part of how I rhetorically think about designing this course, right? It's why, after my initial trailer episode, the very first episode after that is the <i>Karakia</i>.
    A <i>karakia</i> is a kind of chant, a way of&mdash;at least an opening <i>karakia</i> is&mdash;a way of bringing people together, welcoming them into a shared space and asking them to reflect on some of the values and things that will be going on in a course like this, or in a podcast like this. And that's why you and I start by saying <i>Kia ora</i>. <i>Kia ora</i> is a Māori greeting here in Aotearoa, New Zealand.
    There are ways in which my being placed here in Aotearoa New Zealand, where I've learned a lot from Māori culture and I want to foreground those elements for our students explicitly. I think that's part of creating <i>manaakitanga</i>, right, which is this Māori word for kind of wrapping...I like to think of it as like wrapping each other in a warm cloak of <em>hospitality</em>, really.
    </p>
<p>So there are those elements, but also, as I said earlier, these students, many of them are working full time or are parents, are caretakers, et cetera. So this is again, why this <em>asynchronous</em> medium, this <em>audio&ndash;on&ndash;demand</em> is...it is an appropriate medium for them to listen to while they're doing the washing, while they're cooking dinner, while they're making their commutes, right?
    This is a useful way for them to be studying while doing a lot of the other duties that come along with being an online student. That's the first kind of audience. 
    </p>
<p>The second audience is the wider, what I think of as the <i>podcast&ndash;curious public</i>. We always tell our students in the course, Melissa, right: <strong>[<em>exaggerated disciplinary voice</em>]</strong> &ldquo;Don't say you're writing for a general public. That's <em>too vague</em>. That's not helpful.&rdquo; <strong>[<em>laughs</em>]</strong> And that's why I think of our public audience as a <i>podcast&ndash;curious</i> audience. So who's listening to it? Who's not our students? It's a lot of our university colleagues. I know it's other people who wonder how podcasts get made, right?
    I go to the New Zealand Podcast Summit every year, and I know that some listeners, whether they're producers themselves, podcasters, aspiring and budding podcasters, whether they're creators, like quite a few <cite>YouTube</cite> creators, I think, listen. So we've got a diverse mix of people who are interested in lifting the hood on the production of podcasts and the kinds of things to be thinking about when producing podcasts, listening to podcasts and thinking about podcast cultures more largely.
    </p>
<p>So how do I reach that larger secondary audience? Well, for example, that's where I think the Season 2 interviews can be quite helpful. Right? One of the questions that I get the most often, both from students and nonstudents is: <strong>[<em>exaggerated whispering voice</em>]</strong> "How can I make money off of my podcast?" <strong>[<em>Melissa laughs</em>]</strong> I don't have a clue about how to make money off of a podcast!
    I'm a humanities scholar! I'm a rhetoric scholar! <strong>[<em>Melissa laughs again</em>]</strong>  I can talk about culture and language, but making money, I don't know. So that's why the first interview I did was with a <cite>YouTube</cite> creator, Jesse Willson, right? So I'm always thinking about future episodes through the lens of my audience.
    I think also I interviewed Luce Blakiston from the <cite>Shit You Should Care About</cite> media crew, right, who became quite popular during Covid, although they were around for well before that. And I think that's an audience that reaches actually multiple generations. I remember talking with her...she's from the generation below me, but actually she has tons of listeners who are my generation or older.
    So that's a way that we're reaching across these generations cause most of our students are not even high school leavers, right? They're actually closer to my age and I think quite a few of the public listeners are also folks, you know, in a variety of generations, and I think an interview like that with Luce Blakiston from <cite>Shit You Should Care About</cite>&mdash;how do you create this, how do you become a content creator and create a whole media business from scratch?&mdash;that's an interview that can reach a diverse audience both here in Aotearoa New Zealand, but also in the States. 
    </p>
<p>I know that I have listeners in a few other Anglophone countries as well. Not a lot! We don't have, we're not a massive enterprise here. I don't have a lot of money and time to spend on marketing.
    So we're not a big enterprise, but I'd like to think that we're working on creating an enriched community here via <cite>Pod Uni</cite>.

    <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>	
    <p>Are there ways that you think you can improve or modify how the podcast works for its audience or audiences?</p>  
    <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
<p><strong>[<em>musing loudly </em>]</strong> Mmmmm. Mmmmmm. One thing I would <em>love</em> to do is I would love for Season 3 to be student podcasts. <strong>[<em>smiling </em>]</strong> That's what I would love. There are a few like technical, logistical&mdash;hopefully not legal&mdash;hoops that need to be jumped through in order to make that happen. But I think that's another way to reach students...to show off excellent student podcasts that have been produced in our course. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>	
    <p>There have been some great ones.</p>
    <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
    <p><strong>[<em>really excited</em>]</strong> There have been some good ones! Right? Yeah! </p>
<p>But I think also that that showing off  excellent student work also builds a wider community because the students are often plugged into...the stories that they tell on our podcasts are often quite local and they, the students, come with all different kinds of backgrounds and expertise and communities, and that's a way to, again, grow this, and enrich this, <cite>Pod Uni</cite> community because when a student podcast comes up, then they share it with their <i>whānau</i>.
  <i>Whānau</i> is the Māori word for family, right? They share it widely with their <i>whānau</i> and their friends, and it can invite another layer of people into the fold of <cite>Pod Uni</cite>. So I think that's one place I'd like to grow the podcast directly for audience reasons.</p>    
    <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>	
    <p>That sounds great. I think that'd be really interesting to hear those. And I think that they...the student podcasts would also help grow the local podcasting enthusiasm.</p>
    <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
    <p>Totally. I always learn stuff from our student podcasts, right? <strong>[<em>laughs</em>]</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>	
    <p><strong>[<em>smiling</em>]</strong> Yeah, me too.</p>
    <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
    <p>That's one of the great things about when I came here and learned the Māori word <i>ako</i>, which often gets translated into English as...<strong>[<em>pausing</em>]</strong>..."to teach or to learn," but it really does mean that bidirectional thing, right?
        It means bidirectional...that you're...<i>ako</i> is not unidirectional of me the podcast expert saying, <strong>[<em>exaggerated teaching voice </em>]</strong> "Open your brain, and I fill your brain with info." It's actually...we're also learning from our students at the same time as they're learning from us. And I love that that Māori concept of teaching and learning is always bidirectional.
        And I think that's <em>emblematic</em> of what we have in this podcasting class.</p>
        <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>	
        <p>Yeah, That's so true, and two&ndash;way learning is definitely what happens.</p>

<h4><strong>Think capaciously about form, rhetorical purpose, interviewees, and even funding opportunities for a pedagogical podcast.</strong> </h4>

                <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>	

                <p>So, thinking about experts, as a rhetorician yourself, could you tell us about Seasons 1 and 2 of <cite>Pod Uni</cite> through the lens of rhetoric?</p>
            <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>  
<p>Yes. So Season 1, as I said earlier, is <i>monopod</i>. Monopod means it's just me speaking into the mic, not dialogic.
    I do think podcasting is a dialogic medium, so I don't think monopod is necessarily making the most of it, but that's why you and I are doing a dialogue here. But I do think monopod can be instructive for these very how&ndash;to podcasts. So Season 1 is how to do narration, how to do interview technique, how to do story structure, how to do sound design.
    And I was already planning on doing those prior to Covid, but then Covid hit. <strong>[<em>chuckles</em>]</strong> And I think that those came in very helpful as a kind of short, as abbreviated and focused, mini lectures, let's say 18&ndash;minute lectures on each one of these topics. But I hope that they're not just instructing on technique.
    I hope they're also inspiring. I hope they also give space for listeners to imagine themselves conducting an interview with confidence or going into vocal delivery, which many people are quite nervous about, with some kind of understanding of how their bodies, their breath, and their voice can come together to really represent who they are.
    So I <em>hope</em> that they're designed rhetorically to both instruct and to inspire. 
    </p>
<p>As for Season 2, which is a collection of interviews with experts. It's quite diverse. The first thing to say is that I didn't limit it to just podcasters. I think this is maybe the rhetorician in me.
    Rhetoricians are often&mdash;and I would say that you yourself too, Melissa&mdash;we wear many hats. We contain multitudes, right? <strong>[<em>both laugh</em>]</strong> And I think that what I was thinking when I was thinking about who to interview, I thought, "Oh, it's quite narrow if I just interview people who do podcasting."
    Whereas, like when I interviewed Whiti Hereaka&mdash;who is my super smart creative writing colleague here, who won an award for her awesome novel, <cite>Kurangaituku</cite>&mdash;I thought I want to interview her on storytelling. She's an impressive storyteller. She's also written for the stage. So she knows how to write for the ear. Actually, I thought her novel sounded like it was written for the ear.
    So I thought, I think that an interview like that...she's not a podcaster, but I think that can inform how we do podcasting, how we think about writing for the ear, how we think about storytelling. And so I take quite a capacious approach to the interviews on Season 2 cause I think that's valuable to think widely about the many different techniques and skill sets that inform podcasting, not just to think narrowly in terms of who is and is not a podcaster.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
<p>That makes a lot of sense. I like the way that the first season is, as you say, narrow and instructive. Narrow is my word. <strong>[<em>chuckles</em>]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I think that's appropriate. </p>
<p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
<p>Yeah and you've really broadened that out in Season 2 into that much wider net of first going from the dialogic monopod to dialogic, and then also getting a range of interviewees.
    I think that's quite useful. Also for students to listen to as a way of showing that they don't have to do the just one style of podcast, or there's only one type of person to interview. There are many opportunities.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
<p>That's right. That's something we emphasize in the course is that we're constantly showing students different ways of storytelling, vocal delivery, et cetera. What we're NOT trying to do in this course is reproduce a lot of the problematic things <strong>[<em>Melissa chuckles</em>]</strong> that radio has been guilty of for a long time, which is like making everyone sound like a white dude, right? <strong>[<em>Melissa audibly affirms</em>]</strong> Like those kinds of things. So we're being capacious in how we teach the course. But I think also, yeah, I hope that the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> podcast is also capacious. I think there's still room to expand some more.
</p>
<p>Yeah, but it's nascent, let's say. Like, when did the podcast come out? We've been doing it for three&ndash;ish years now. And of course, <em>teaching</em> podcasting is part of my job, but <em>producing</em> a podcast is not explicitly a part of my job, even though it is a pedagogical tool.
    I would love to get some funding. I think one way that the podcast could grow is getting some funding to bring more people into the fold of the production side of things...to grow it and get more heads in on the future directions of this so that, yeah, so that it can be more community driven, I guess.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
    <p>Yeah, a lot of podcasts do have a full team behind them, although there are also plenty of solo podcasts as well.</p>

              <h2>Pros &amp; Cons</h2>
            </header>
<p>When designing a pedagogical podcast for OWI, we argue that a pedagogical podcast can complement and amplify existing online writing pedagogies, but like any pedagogical tool, it’s not without its downsides. In the following audio clip, Dr. Gunn discusses some of the benefits and drawbacks of both producing and teaching with a pedagogical podcast in OWI. In the concluding section, we connect some of these pros and cons to existing scholarship and expand on them. </p>
			  
			  <h3><strong>Benefits:</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li>A pedagogical podcast is a helpful resource for online students, especially ones who have lots of time constraints (e.g. parents, full&ndash;time workers, and caretakers).</li>
	<li>A pedagogical podcast helps instructors empathise with students engaged in multimodal composition.</li>
	<li>A pedagogical podcast is a valuable multidisciplinary and multimodal activity for instructors’ own professional development.</li>
</ul>
		  
<h3><strong>Drawbacks:</strong></h3>
	<ul>
		<li>It is a mountain of work to produce and promote a pedagogical podcast to a high standard, which is especially difficult for contingent faculty in precarious positions.</li>
		<li>Not all students listen to the pedagogical podcast, including the students who may need it most (which is a perennial problem in teaching).</li>
		<li>Producing a public&ndash;facing pedagogical podcast presents a privacy risk for instructors. </li>
		<li>Sharing examples of student podcasts poses privacy risks for students and often requires navigating some institutional bureaucracy. </li>

    <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p> 
<p>So tell me a little bit more about what your own experience has been teaching <cite>Pod Uni</cite> the podcast or teaching with it. Because when I asked if you wanted to coteach this with me, I had sort of already...or I was in the process of getting this up and running and then said, "Hey, here's this teaching tool."
    So I'd be curious to know a little bit more about your own experience using the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> podcast in our pedagogy.</p>
    <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
    <p>Sure. I guess the first thing is, perhaps, the most obvious thing for anyone who has taught students, is that the more motivated students are the ones who report listening to it most.</p>
    <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
    <p>That's right. I'm under no illusion that every single student listens to every episode. <strong>[<em>laughs</em>]</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
    <p>Yeah, that's inevitable. But I do think that the more practical monopod, the first series, is a really useful primer for those, especially for those who are new to producing a podcast. And I think that they do get a lot of listens, possibly only in the last few weeks when they're desperately trying to catch up to making their podcast <strong>[<em>both chuckling</em>]</strong>, but I think that they do view that as a useful resource. Because it is definitely...the more enthusiastic ones do appreciate the second series episodes as examples, and so I think actually they would <em>love</em> to have that opportunity of hearing more shorter narrative nonfiction podcasts as examples for themselves because if there's one thing I've learnt that students love to have examples.
        </p>
    <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
     <p>Yes. So you're saying if we put more student examples up as a third season, they would appreciate that? Yeah, that's right.</p>
     <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
     <p>Yeah. It's really useful for students to have the ability to listen to something on the go. Particularly those asynchronous students, the distance students who have a lot going on in their lives. If you can just plug your earpods in and listen to the podcast while you're doing other things, it's so helpful when you're trying to juggle your multiple time commitments. And I think that they appreciate that. One of the difficult things I think is that potentially the students who could do with listening to it the most don't necessarily get that listening in.
        I think that's also a perennial teaching problem. But they do, all the students, I think, listen to more podcasts by the end of the course than when they started. I know that we've had some students who have never listened to a podcast before, but by the end of the course, they've listened to a whole slew of them, and some of them have become absolutely converts to podcasting.
        So I think that the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> is part of that. So even though they might not have <cite>Pod Uni</cite> on a multiple play repeat list, they're still getting something from the course.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p> 
<p>I hope so. Yeah. Aw, that's good to hear.</p>
<p>Tell me about your experience <em>producing</em> some of the...you've produced three of the most recent episodes...<strong>[<em>Melissa laughs</em>]</strong> What's it been like to be on the back end of this pedagogical tool?</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
<p>Oh, it's been really interesting. I have so much more sympathy with the students producing their podcasts now. <strong>[<em>laughs again</em>]</strong> But useful also to view it from both sides. So to have, okay, we've got this tool that we can listen to. How does it work?
    What are the moving parts? And how do they fit together? So that's been really useful for me to, like I said, to have sympathy, but also have a better understanding of some of the challenges that student podcasters can have using different equipment, making a space more friendly for podcasting.
    So it makes me think about technical challenges and search for solutions. But it also makes me appreciate how much tools make a difference, so it's absolutely possible to make a podcast with the most basic of tools, but sometimes having better tools makes it better. <strong>[<em>laughs knowingly</em>]</strong>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, it saves time usually. And you're editing in <cite>Audacity</cite>, the free open source software. And you've had to tidy up some of my <em>less high quality audio</em>, let's say the particular...doing the live episode of the podcast at the New Zealand Podcast Summit. I think was quite the challenge for you to produce that episode.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
        <p><strong>[<em>knowingly</em>]</strong> Yeah, that was an interesting introduction to editing live.</p>
        <p><strong>Collin Bjork</strong></p>
        <p>Yeah. Thank you for your <i>mahi</i> on that. <i>Mahi</i> is the Māori word for work. Yeah, appreciate the work that went into that.</p>
        <p>Yeah, and I think I feel the same way. You said that you have a more kind of sympathy or empathy for and with the students. And I totally agree.
            Every time...cause I only do these episodes every few months. I'm not doing it weekly by any stretch of the imagination. I think every time I get back into it, I go, <strong>[<em>mock surprised voice</em>]</strong> "Oh, right, this does require a lot of different things." Both the software, the listening, the microphone technique, the writing, the episode descriptions, gathering the transcripts, putting the transcripts on the website, right?
            There's a lot that goes into this work. So I always, every time I do it, I'm reminded of those challenges.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Melissa Gunn</strong></p>
            <p><strong>[<em>chuckling</em>]</strong> Yeah, it's a multidisciplinary task really, which is one of the things I really like about it actually, because you have different things to focus on at different times. So you've got your practical, getting the sound in the first place, then you've got editing the sound. Or actually, you're, first of all, you're academic writing, the questions, thinking about what you want to ask, doing the interview, so getting the sound, and then cleaning it up <strong>[<em>chuckles knowingly</em>]</strong>, making it sound the way you really wanted it to sound. They're all a lot of different skills that go into it. </p>

              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            </header>
<p>As we outline above, when teaching multimodal composition online, a pedagogical podcast can complement existing pedagogies by providing students with an opportunity to engage course content on their own time in a medium that aligns with both their multimodal writing goals and with their needs as online students. In this sense, a pedagogical podcast aligns with elements of the “PARS” method of teaching writing online (Borgman & McArdle, 2019). Among the four pillars of this PARS method&mdash;personal, accessible, responsive, and strategic&mdash;a pedagogical podcast especially amplifies the “personal” (17) and “strategic” (71) elements. A pedagogical podcast enhances the “personal” side of online writing instruction insofar as it functions as a kind of “personal space to engage with your students” (29), one that enacts a user&ndash;centered design by helping “establish your ethos with your students” (19). Even the co&ndash;production of this webtext&mdash;which is a collaboration between a permanent and an adjunct faculty member&mdash;can be considered as a kind of “personal administration” (26) in which the development of a personal relationship between a WPA and an instructor augments the overall teaching environment. In terms of the PARS method, a pedagogical podcast is also part of the “strategic design” (72) in an asynchronous online multimodal composition course that asks students to compose with audio. It models for students how to compose with audio, and it allows students to access course materials even without a continuous internet connection, which improves accessibility for online students. </p>
<p>A pedagogical podcast also provides other potential benefits that require further research. For example, our discussion above hypothesizes that a pedagogical podcast could offer an opportunity to showcase examples of multimodal composition and prior students’ work in a medium appropriate&ndash;manner. Showcasing student work could potentially amplify both the “personal” and “strategic” elements of the PARS method by providing targeted models for student audio compositions that also establish a sense of connection among students past, present, and future. Furthermore, as a public&ndash;facing medium, a pedagogical podcast can potentially help connect university communities with larger public interest groups, which illustrates how a pedagogical podcast is a kind of public writing that has the potential to reach across “town and gown” divides (Accardi, 2017). In this way, a pedagogical podcast deployed in certain instructional contexts could align with community writing initiatives (e.g. Knight, 2022), especially when the podcast emphasizes co&ndash;composing with local communities and those student&ndash;produced episodes are then shared on the pedagogical podcast. Lastly, we have only tested the use of a pedagogical podcast in hybrid and fully online courses, meaning that it remains up to future researchers to evaluate whether a pedagogical podcast could also prove fruitful in face&ndash;to&ndash;face composition courses. </p>
<p>At the same time, however, a pedagogical podcast presents some significant downsides to online writing instructors. The biggest of these drawbacks is the sheer amount of extra work it takes to create a high&ndash;quality pedagogical podcast. Rarely are online writing instructors given extra time to create teaching materials like a pedagogical podcast that may be seen as supplementary by those who hold the purse strings, which can inhibit other instructors, especially those in precarious positions, from creating a pedagogical podcast. In our case, neither Dr. Bjork nor Dr. Gunn were fully compensated for their labor on this podcast. Dr. Bjork took a leading role in designing and producing the podcast because his labor was partially accounted for through his full-time permanent position. By contrast, Dr. Gunn took a smaller role because her labor on the podcast was not covered by her adjunct teaching contract. We were able to secure a grant to partially account for her work as producer on several episodes, but her contributions as an interviewee on two episodes were unpaid labor. The same goes for this webtext: even though Dr. Gunn has a long track record of publishing peer&ndash;reviewed research, she has no such research provision in her teaching contract, so Dr Bjork took a larger role in composing this webtext because conducting research is an explicit part of his role. This difference in our relative contributions to this webtext and to the <cite>Pod Uni</cite> podcast highlights long&ndash;running labor inequities in our discipline (Kahn, Lalicker, & Lynch&ndash;Biniek, 2017). It also illustrates how the potential benefits of new teaching tools such as pedagogical podcasts are dis&ndash;incentivized by the neoliberal austerity measures that often structure online writing instruction (Welch & Scott, 2016). One additional disadvantage of creating a public&ndash;facing podcast is the risk to instructors’ privacy. In our current moment, such privacy concerns are amplified because generative artificial intelligence (AI) increases the ease with which bad actors can take advantage of someone’s voice or likeness, which could result in embarrassment, deep fakes, or doxxing. Generative AI is thus not only a risk to educational equality (Bjork, 2023), it also threatens the teachers who seek to enable equity in education through student&ndash;centered pedagogies like this. We chose to make <cite>Pod Uni</cite> an audio&ndash;only podcast, which minimizes the visual privacy risks and also reduces some of the labor associated with producing a podcast. Yet we fully understand that the privacy risks associated with creating a public&ndash;facing podcast, especially for those in precarious positions, may not be worth it for some instructors. </p>
<p>A pedagogical podcast is therefore both an opportunity and burden for online writing instructors. In an online audio composition course, a pedagogical podcast is a productive way to engage students and to complement existing pedagogical strategies. And although podcasts can sometimes appear to exist in an amorphous digital ether that is detached from a local context, we found that it was enriching for both our students and for our wider listenership to ground our podcast in our immediate cultural context here on Māori whenua in Aotearoa New Zealand. Yet despite these benefits, we cannot uniformly recommend that other instructors produce similar pedagogical podcasts until the labor issues that have long plagued our discipline and our universities are fully addressed. Indeed, for online writing instructors, the decision whether or not to produce a pedagogical podcast echoes what Professor Sano&ndash;Franchini asked at the conclusion of her CCCC Chair’s Address, “How should we continue to make intentional choices about where and how we are going to place our labor, intellectual energy, and personal content?” (14). And given all of the demands on online writing instructors today, a pedagogical podcast may not be a top priority for instructors. Still, we offer this case study of a pedagogical podcasting in online writing instruction as an example of both the structural issues that limit our discipline and the pedagogical potential of investing in innovative methods of teaching multimodal composition online. </p>
